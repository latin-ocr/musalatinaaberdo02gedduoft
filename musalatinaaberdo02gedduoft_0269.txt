7. DE EFFIGIE DOMINAE DE COLLO PENDENTE.

Non tibi crus ambit variata periseelis auro,
Et Rubri spoliis ambitiosa maris.
Sed neque fers humero stellam, quae lumina Phoebi
Vincit, ab aurato curn movet axe diem.
Pectore tu dominam gestas, quam pinxit ApelleS‚
Aurea concludit capsa, Myronis opus.
Hanc ubi contrectas, Gordoni, vulnera sentis,
Et quoties spectas, Cypridis igne cales.
Vincla pedum quid laudis habent vel sidera caeli Ρ
Sideream plus est pectore ferre Deam. 10

8. ΟΝ Α FALL OF THE SAME FROM HIS HORSE.

Wild steed, for your mischief in daring to harm Gordon by a stumble‚
what punishment should I not wish for you? Off with your trappings and
saddle along with your bridle; let no comb tend your back or mane. Don
panniers henceforth, and, paired with a donkey, turn the mill, or, like an ox,
, draw the wain. No rank for you as colt of a generous herd; a brute you are,
prime glory of a slow-stepping breed. No Scythian hills nor land of Africa
gave you being, nor yet Astur renowned for noble steeds. 'Tis Pluto's steeds
that begat you beside Tartarean lakes. Pegasus cast off his master, but
climbed the heaven ; ’tis meet for you to go to the stall of Stygian Jove.
