LXXIII. ΟΝ BISHOP “EUDOXUS’S’' FIELD. ’

ARGUMENT.

Instead of oats sown by you beside the waters, there springs up only
mustard in the glebe. No Circe operated here with spells„ nor—-She that
made old men young—Medea with incantatione. Health and Jove and
mother earth were prospecting {ot your old age. Oats‚ the food of poor
oxen, might hurt a shivering old 1nan3 but mustard, as Pythagoras can
witness, may send a flood of fire along your frozen veins.

2. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SAME.

Mustard, the product of Egyptian soil, Pliny and Galen both extol.
Commend rne to the mustard that met my eye in a prelate's glebe in the far
North. The Nilotic product operates only at close quarters and stirs tears3
afar off, the northern plant drew tem-s from the prelate’s eyes when he saw
rt growmg.

3. ΟΝ THE SAME.

The bishop's field is here: one part rampant with hot mustard3 one
part feeds fat oxen. Slay the oxen, prelate: spontaneous condiment is
near; and let us have “ beef and mustard’'.
