14 EPIGRAMMATA.

LIV. ΟΝ THE CITY OF ABERDEEN.

A quaint, old metrica] English translation of this epigram appearing in Skene’s
Memorials os Scottislz BurghS, was made by John Barclay, minister at Cruden, about 1685,
as to whom see Collections‚ Spald. Club (p. 52). This version may come more appropriately
later, with the Encomia Urbium.

ARGUMENT.

If you admire Rome and its people as the world’s sovereign lady and
the world's denght, bring into the arena of comparison lovely Aberdeen.
Thetis washes it with obedient waves‚just as the Imperial City adjoins its
handmaid sea. Both look down from heights on subject streams‚ and breathe
martial threats‚ each from her thundering citadel. The former boasts of her
Fabii, her Scipios‚ her Caesars. The other recalls with pride her Menzieses‚
her Cullens, her Collisons and her Lawsons. The Grampian city is smaller
than that of Romulus, but her burgesses are men, in heart and head, as good
as of ancient Rome.
