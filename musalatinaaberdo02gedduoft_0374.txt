278 ENCOMIA URBIUM.

*ff As a specimen of worthy John Barclay's somewhat feeble versification with its
quaint old spelling, is appended his translation of this epigram on New Aberdeen.

NEvv-ABERDEEN enrich'd by Dees clear streams
All praise from ancient Cities justly claims3

It's blessed with Churches famous in all lands,
And Temples framed by no mortall hands.
Muses alse famous as once Rome did grace,
Have hallowed a H ouse into this place.

A Collega may be seen not far from thence,
Where Learning fixed hath its residenee.

The M erent-place where men resort for gain,

Is stretched out into a spacious plain3

There you the stately Judgemcnt·H0use may view
Whose Battlements are of a Starry-Hew;

There Palaces of Peers you may espy,

Whose Lofty-Tops approach unto the Sky,

And Towns-Mens-Houscs there you may behold
Which garnish'd are and shining like the Gold.
What need I further the three Hills to name
Which as three Bulwarks fortifie the Same.
Like these on which that City doeth stand,
Which once as Head did all the Earth command.
The Wool-man-hill which all the rest outvyes
In pleasantness, this City beautifies:

There is the Well of spa, that healthfull Font,
Whose Ir'ne-lzew'd Water colloureth the Mount.
Not far from thence a Garden's to be seen,
Which unto Jameson did appertain:

Wherein a little pleasant House doth stand,
Painted (as Ι guess) with its Masters hand.

Dee doth afford of Salmon wondrous store,

The Neighbour-Sea brings up into the shore.
The riches whereof Egypt makes her boast‚

And Inciian-trcasurcs come into this Coast.

A Bridge doth reach along the River Dee,
Wherein seven double stately Archcs be ;

Who built this sumptuous-work if ye would know,
The Mytcr which is catv'd thereon doth show.
But let the Vulgar sort these things command,
The Citizens to praise 1 do intend.
