MEMorR OF ARTHUR JOHNS’roN. xvii

One might have expected Inverury, as being nearer to Caskieben, to have
supplied instruction; but although he has an encomium on that town also,
it is to Kintore he gives the credit of his early training. It is singular
that we know more of his school than of his college training, and al-
though Aberdeen was no doubt the place of the latter, it is not very clear
which of its two colleges he attended.¹ The chief glimpse of his youthful
student years we obtain from his biographical epistle (No. XXIX. of Vol. Ι.)
addressed to David Wedderburn, containing reminiscences oftheiryouthful dayS,
from which we learn that he enjoyed to the full, in company with his young
friend, the sports of mountain climbing and other youthful recreations, no
doubt including expeditions for the sake of angling, of which, judging from
his piscatorial poems, johnston must have been extremely fond.

After he has finished his Scottish education, he betakes himself, being a
younger son that had to look out for himself, to the continent, and we first
find him at the Casimir College of Heidelberg in the autumn of 1599. The
authority for this fact, recently discovered, and now for the first time included
in his biography, will, with all details, be found in the Appendix‚ and it is
really the first reliable date as to Arthur Johnston⁷s career. The brilliant
youth enrols first as a student, but ere long, viz„ in 1601, we find him presiding
as professor at a scholastic disputation in the same seminary, and the thesis
on the occasion still remains as evidence of his having sojourned at Heidel—
berg and occupied a chair there as his first position. (See Appendix No. 1.)
Although Heidelberg was his first habitat on the continent, it did not long
retain him, for we soon find evidence of his location at another city with which
he is more associated than with any other continental town,—-Sedan. Still
Heidelberg must have interested him greatly, as some of his earliest poems
were printed at the Heidelberg press, and we can now easily account for the
. fervid interest he shows in the fortunes of the Palatinate2 and the city of the
Neckar under the outbreak of the Thirty Years' WVar in 1619. The attraction
that drew him from Heidelberg to Sedan was no doubt the invitation received
from Henri de la Tour, the sovereign prince of Sedan, and through marriage
with his first wife, bearer of the august title of Duc de Bouillon. Such invita-
tion had been issued by this prince in pursuance of his favourite scheme of
fostering a university at Sedan. (See Appendix No. II.) The Duc de Bouil-
lon was closely connected with the Electoral family of the Palatinate, and

¹Lauder says it was the King's College; Kennedy, Annals, 11„ 112, claims him for
Marischal College‚ as does also Alexander Johnston in his Genealogiffll Aci-amet astho Family
os Johnston, 1832, followed by Sir C. F. Shand in Furzerals, p. 18.
