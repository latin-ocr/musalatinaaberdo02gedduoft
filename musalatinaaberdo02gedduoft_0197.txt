3. OF DUNKELD.

1644, see Dr. Grub, passim. Seal of, in Laing's Smls, II. No. 1027.

Virtue and to Himself.

3. DEUCALEDONIUS.

Quas sibi Lindsaeus sola virtute paravit,
Virtuti famulas et sibi fecit opes,

Deucaledonius.] This spelling occurs in the Epigrammata of 1632, in the Dc‘litz'ac,
and in the Middelburg edition. It is probably a typographical error for “Dlmcaledonius''
which Buehanan takes as the true form, even in Ptoleiny. The see of Dunkeld ranked third,
next to the two archbishoprics.
