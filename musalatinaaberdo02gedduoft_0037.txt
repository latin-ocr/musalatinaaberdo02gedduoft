man was already Μειδίαν ofArts z'n 1599. Ι think that proves that he was
born before 1587, if this Arthur is identical with the Latinist of the
seventeenth century.⁷' (See Appendix No. ΙΙΙ.)

Here there was irresistible evidence that the birth date of 1587 for a
Professor of Philosophy presiding at a disputation in 1599 must be a mistake,
but further it was a discovery to learn that Johnston had studied and taught
at Heidelberg before betaking himself to Sedan.

The most important Biography ofJohnston, as already indicated, that of
the Abbe Boulliot, makes no mention of the Heidelberg period, but brings
him to Sedan as early as November, 1603. The Abbe is evidently perplexed
even by this date for a youth born in 1587, for he says apologetically :—

“ Il fit ses <Studes dans sa patrie. A seize ans ses talents etaient de-
veloppes comme s'il eut atteint l’age mur. . . . He continues thereafter:
Attire a Sedan . . . il y’arriva dans les premiers jours de November, 1603,
accompagne de Gualtier Donaldson‚ son compatriote. Le 22 de ce mois il
fut nomme Regent de la troisieme classe du college academique. L'Univer-
site, frappee de ses heureuses dispositions et de ses talents prematures, le fit
passer a la seconde classe le 1ojuillet, 1604, et le nomma en meme temps
professeur de logique et de metaphysique. Il exerca durant six ans ces
emplois.'’

From thelabove evidence as to his Heidelberg studies in 1599, it is clear
that the birth date of 1587 cannot be maintained. The probability is that it
was reached by an estimate formed from the inscription on the (Middelburg
Edition) vignette‚ where 1639 appears instead of what turns out to be the more
correct figure, 1629, which, as we have said, is found on the Portrait in the
Lauder Edition of 1739. How Lauder came to give the birth date as 1587,
with “ aetat. 52, 1629,” in the Frontispiece of his own book is hard to under-
stand, and Ι leave the crux for others to unravel.1

1740, as the following letter shows, for which Ι am indebted to Surg.-Col. Johnston, of Newton

me by Mr. Whatley, together with a Latin Version on the blank columns.² As the design is
to print it in this manner, for the sake os those who are less skilled in the Latin, nothing
more could fitly be aimed at in the version, but propriety and perspicuity. 1 have, therefore.
