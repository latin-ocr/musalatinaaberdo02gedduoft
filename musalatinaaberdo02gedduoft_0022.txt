inscribed as above and “Jameison'’ (sic). An undoubted example [of Jamesone].
An oldish, spate man, with a cap worn in a jaunty way, somewhat to one side, and a
ruff. Greyish moustache and chin beard. The picture possesses a good deal of
character. ’

Forbes of Tolquhon is well known in the North as of a family at once ancient and
honourable‚ namely, that of the Lords Forbes. The subject of the picture built the
castle of Tolquhon. His daughter was married to Sir Al. Fraser of Philorth3 hence
his presence here [at Philorth]. Bulloch's Jamesonc, p. 173.

PoRTRAlr OF JoHN URQUHART OF CRAIGSTON (1547-1631). To face p. 91.
Through the kind perniissiori of Colone] Morison of Mountblairy‚
owner of the portrait.

This is probably a portrait of the “Tutor of Cromarty,'' so called from the circum-
stance that, as granduncle os the eccentric translator os Rabehis, Sir Thomas Urquhart
of Cromarty‚ he became tutor or trustee of that gentleman¹s affairs. He died in
November, 1631, and in an epitaph in King-Edward Church, Arthur Johnston bewails
him thus:-—-

“ Posteritas cui liquit agros et praedia, disce
Illius exemplo vivere, disce mori.''
The portrait has perhaps been slightly touched, but remains an excellent example of
Jamesone. He has long hair flowing to his shoulders, a piercing dark eye, and a
happy expression. A Cromwellian collar over a dark coat forms his simple attire.
