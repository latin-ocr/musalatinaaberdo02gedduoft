EPIGRAMS. 151

B. THE SAME.

Of the high and mighty Prince, sprung from high and mighty ancestors‚
what an embryo image the small tablet doth supply! Within this portrait
you can at the same time gaze upon his father's countenance‚ and one can
discern the lineaments of both his grandsires. The right hand bears the olive,
the other hand the laurel: the laurel points out the lord of Arms, the olive that
of the Gown. Be these thy distinctions, boy: the olive which thou bearest
comes from james, the laurel from Henri [Quatre]: each is a gift from thy sire.

Β. EIUSDEM.
Principis ingentis, proavis ingentibus orti,
Quale rudimentum parva tabella dedit !
Hac simul et patrios spectas in imagine vultus,
Et gemini quivis ora tuetur avi.
Dextera fert oleam, laurum manus altera, laurus 5
Armorum dominum monstrat, oliva togae.
His claresce puer3 quam fers Iacobus olivam,
Henricus laurum, donat utramque pater.

6. Oliva] See No. IX. on James 1., “the Pacific ”.

4. THE DUKE oF YORK’s (i.e., the future James ΙΙ.).

Here let us admire the young Duke⁷s likeness: while you see in it looks
of martial strength, you see also looks that charm. ln one and the same
image there breathe at once threats and smiles3 both Mars and Venus gleam
out together in the delicate countenance. Vulcan beholding it bursts into his ,ι
wonted rage, and calls the heavens to witness his impeachment. The Powers,

he swears‚ whom Cynthius caught in one conch, have now come together in one
painted board.

4. DUCIS EBORACENSIS.
Hic Ducis effigiem pueri miremur: in illa
Martia dum spectas ora, venusta vides. 10
Una minas spirat simul et blanditur imago,
Et Mars et tenero lucet in ore Venus.
Mulciber hanc spectans solitas exarsit in iras,
Et superos testes criminis esse iubet.
Quos olim in thalamo deprendit Cynthius uno,
In tabula iurat iam coiisse Deos.

13. Mulciber.] Same allusion as occurs in No¹ LVI„ l. 18.
