LXXI. ΟΝ CARPESIUS’1 GARDEN.

ARGUMENT.

Elsewhere one may gather plums, with waxy bloom, and mulberry fruit,
and choice dessert—apples, pears, cherries‚ chestnuts. Your garden yields
cloven leekS, green mallows‚ cabbage-sprouts, lettuce, beet-root, common
kail. Two narcissi one may see, three curved irises, four lilies, five roses;
the rest are weeds and hemlock‚ nettles and ferns. No need of Priapus
or a wakeful dragon to keep this garden. Its own poverty makes all secure.

2. ΟΝ THE SAME.

Tiny garden, which Carpesius prizes as much as his own eyes, is the
smallest, poorest thing. A cobweb might hide it, or a flea jump over it, or a
frog, as it croaks “koash'' in the water. Ere Automedon could pull rein,
it could be dug up by a hungry dwarf. A poor market-gardener could hardly
gather seeds that would fill a pigmy’s palm. A breakfast for a mouse or a
meal for a grasshopper-nay, it jwould hardly give kail to the beggar Irus.
Yet Carpesius is as proud of it as of the gardens of Alcinous. A quartan
fever we have read of so heralded: little flea‚2 in such strain ran your praise.

3. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SAME.

'Tis wrong in me to jibe you, gardener for poor Carpesius: the same
infirmity is mine. All along, the Aonian field, which Ι have cultivated from
infancy, has cheated me. Your garden brings forth nettles and thistles:
mine gives its master only promises. Ι have given it the go by with
Phoebus, and the Muses to boot; say you the same, if you are wise.
“ Garden, good-bye.’‘

¹ This name is a puzzle unsolved, and so the allusions of this group are lost.
“-’ Probably refers to such mock-heroic poenis as the ‘⁵ culex ” of Virgil.
