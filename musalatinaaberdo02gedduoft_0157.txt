EPIGRAMS. 77

XCIX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF [LADY] JANE MAITLAND,
DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF LAUDERDALE.

(See another Tribute in No. LXVII.)

ARGUMENT.

A period of four olympiads [sixteen years] closed her eyes upon this
world, although she shone the hope of the peerage and the darling of her
native land. Before Juno could light up the nuptial torch, grim death
plunged her in the Lethaean wave. Nettles may expect to live long, and
the bur survives till winter's snows But 'tis the violet and the tendet rose
and the white lily of the meadow that you see at once bloom in spring and
fade.

XCIX. IN OBITUM IOHANNAE METELLANAE LADER-
DELIAE COMITIS FILIAE.

Quarta Metellanam subtraxit olympias orbi,
Spem procerum, patrii deliciasque soli.

Ante Deae quam Iuno sacros accenderet ignes,
Mors fera Lethaeae gurgite mersit aquae.

Scilicet urticis fas est sperare senectam,
Lappa nec hibernas depcrit ante nives.

Sed violas, tenerasque rosaS, et candida prati
Lilia vere vides surgere, vere mori.

5. Urticis.] The sentiment is akin to Wordsworth's lines :-
“ Ο sir, the good die first,
While they whose hearts are dry as summer dust Burn to the socket ⁷³.
