ENCOMIA URBIUM. 255

CLXVI. EPIGRAMS IN HONOUR OF SOME OF THE MORE

FAMOUS CITIES AND TOWNS OF SCOTLAND.

This series appears first in the Middelburg edition, 1642. Reprinted by Skene in his
“ succinet survey of the famous city of Aberdeen,” John F orbes, 1685. A translation of the
group into English was made by J. B. [John Barclay], minister at Cruden, who however
adopted an order of his own, placing Aberdeen first. His version is rather poor, as is seen from
the specimen given ,under No. 17. On J. B., see Collections (Sp. CL), p. 52; also Maidment's
Scottish Elegiae Verses, p. 14.-—This series of poems is an imitation, in ancient literature, of
Ausonius in his “Garland'' of the cities of the empire, and, in modern Latin literature, of
Julius Caesar Scaliger in his series of “ Urbes '' (Del. Poet. Ital„ Vol. IL). So Johnston’s
friend, Caspar Barlaeus, has a group of Dutch towns similarly treated, beginning with
Dordrechtum (Dort), Harlemum, etc. (Barlaei, Miscellanea, p. 201).

Arthur Johnston alludes to this performance of his in the poem (see No. CXLIV.) to
his friend William Spang, who published them in the collected edition of 1642.

It is somewhat odd that while Lowland Scotland is fairly well represented in this serieS,
Inverlochy near Ben Nevis, in the heart of the Highland region, should have been in those
days within the ken of the writer; and that Arbroath, the city of the great abbey, in the centre
os the Lowlands, is left out.

In some editions of Camden these epigrams are erroneously ascribed to John Johnston,
the kinsman of Arthur, who, though hailing from Aberdeen, lived most of his time at St.
Andrews. It is true that a series of similar Latin epigrams to Scottish towns appears in Dr.
George Mackenzie’s Lives of Scottish Writers and in connection with the Life of Hector
Boece in Vol. ΙΙ., but those appearing there are clearly assigned (II. p. 419) to the
Johnston who was Professor of Divinity at St. Andrews. Still the series by John Johnston is
interesting, although the sketches are as a rule not equal to those from the pen of Arthur.
The evidence derivable from the poems Nos. CXLIV. and CLXVI. 20, is conclusive as to
Arthur being author of those in the Middelburg edition.

1 . EDINBURGH.

The stateliness and beauty of Edinburgh are portrayed with pride. Holyrood and the
Castle form the extremes; the Parliament House and St. Giles’ fill up the middle of the
picture, and the whole has for centre the crown of St. Giles’. Yet three other of the towns
have longer tributes. Another of the same by John Johnston on Edinburgh is found in
Mackenzie’s Scottish PVriters, ΙΙ. p. 402. Compare also the earlier sketch of Edinburgh by

η our author in Vol. I. pp. 42-3.

To enjoy her heavenly view, Edina rises on her sloping ridge, looking
down on rich domains of Ceres and the Nymphs and eke on the tributary sea.
To the East under Arthur's Seat the Palace is beheld. To the West the Castle
commands the city with its thunderbolts of war. In the midst there stands a
temple, ornament of the city and the world, the abode of Piety: resplendent
within and surmounted by a regal crown of fretted stone. The abode of
Justice adjoins, worthy of Polycletus and Praxiteles. The burghers dwell in
noble mansions fit for heroes and sear no threats of danger. Tiber puts Rome
in terror, and the sea threatens Venice: at such threats Edina smiles. No
city worthier of the sceptre ; no site more suited for the lordship of the land.
