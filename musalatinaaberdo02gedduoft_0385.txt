4. Epigrams on Chancellor John Maitland in Delit., 1.‚ 267; II.‚ 116.

Samuel Naeranus, acccording to Charles Peyran’s Histoire de l’Academie de Scdan,
was born at Dort about 1580, succeeded Berehet in chair of Rhetoric at Sedan in 1605,
and died at Amersfort in 1642. He was the composer of verses prefixed to the Code of
Regulations for Discipline of the Students at Sedan in 1608, of which excellent regula-
tions Mons. Brincourt has furnished a reprint. If Naeranus died as late as 1642,

the title of Johnston’s poem is more probably “on Samuel Naeranus’s funereal
tears‚” referring to his Elegiae poems on others.

. Budaeus.——-Likeness of, in Paul Jovius, Vitae Illustr. Vir.

. Rev. John Archibald translates in well-turned verse this Epigram, No. LXIV. (History

of Episcopal Church ⁰f Keitlz, p. 21); also Epigram, No. XCVII.‚ 2, and CXV.‚ 5,
in same work (Edinb.‚ 1890).

. Fine English letter of Drummond on Poesy, addressed to Arthur Johnston, in Mas-

son’s Drummond, p. 357 and p. 143 of Drummond’s works.

. LXXXV.--The occasion of this poem was the death of the duke’s daughter, the
Princess Louise, on eth December, 1607, at the age of twelve. The Abbe Boulliot,
referring to this Epigram (“ sur la mort de la princesse Louise sa fille ainee ’'), has
a note as follows :—

“ Louis Cappel le jeune a traite le meme sujet. La princesse Louise est morte le
6 Decembre, 1607, agee de douze ans.’'

. LXXXIX—The remark on Crawfurd's interpretation as to the duration of an “ Olyrn-

pias” is modified by the later note on p. 242.

. The following is the transcript of the Receipt given by Arthur Johnston to Mons. Stas-

quin, as still extant at 54 Les Peres Saints (“ Collection Coquerel, Recus de Sedan ”).
(There is also an autograph receipt os Andr. Melville, signed MELvm.)

‘⁴ Je soubsigne confesse d’avoir eu et receu de Mons. Stasquin receveur du College et
biens ecclesiastiques de Sedan la somme de cent vingt cinque livres tourn. pour
un quartier de ma pension commence par annee au premier jour du moys de
Jenvier et qui expirera au dernier jour du moys prochain.

“ Faict le vingt quatriesme jour de Jenvier de l'an mil six cents neufs.

‘⁸ ART. IONSTON,
“ Professeur en Logique et Metaphysique.'’

. . For ‘⁴ The Scottish Nobles,'’ read ‘⁴ Scottish Nobles ’'. Several are unacknowledged,

such as Earl of Montrose‚ etc. The Middelburg Edition gives the title ‘⁴ Nobiles
quidam Scoti,'' which is more correct. Lauder (Musae Sacrae, p. lv.) remarks the
fact and endeavours to account for omissions.
