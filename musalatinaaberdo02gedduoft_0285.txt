CXXXVII. TOMB OF THE MOST NOBLE AND HIGH-
SPIRITED LADY, ANNE CAMPBELL, MARCHIONESS
OF HUNTLY.

See No. LXXIV.‚ where also “ Heroina''. There appears to be no trace now of any
such monument in Bishop Lichton’s‚ otherwise St. John's, aisle, forming the north transept,
in Old Machar church; we can only guess the spot. See Orem (ed. 1830), p. 107, on its
later name, the Gordon’s aisle‚ and Spalding Trubles, Ι. 90, on decease and burial of this
marchioness in 1638.

ARGUMENT.

Erect for Cambella a tomb of pure marble, in this spot where you see the
lineaments of Lichton the Prelate. Let the elaborate structure repose on
Phrygian columns, and let the apex of the mausoleum touch the clouds. In the
midst a Goddess is to be carved, whose locks would outshine gold, whose eyes
the stars, whose breast ivory. Let the image of her consort Huntly be carved
close by, bearing the martial features of her thundering chief. Let the white
marbles be variegated with noble gems and the spoils of the Red Sea and the
Sea of Sidon. Heap sapphires, diarnonds, jaspers, and the fires that chryso-
lite can yield or the pyropus. Nor let the gleam of silver be awanting nor of
rich gold, such as the people of Peru gather in their native hills. Let Art
giving priceless value form a faultless masterpiece of earving, worthy of the
hand of Phidias or Praxiteles. In such a shrine she who was the paragon of
all worth and of all beauty deserved to lie, or in one finer still.
