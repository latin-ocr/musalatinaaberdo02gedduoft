CIV. DE GULIELMO FORBESIO TOLCHONO.

Auxisset cum prole domum Tolchonus et arvis,
Confectus senio sponte reliquit humum.

Condidit hunc tumulum, quo conditur ipse, supremum
Exspectans animo nil metuente diem.

Hune prope pauperibus devotos aspicis agros,
Tectaque mortali non violanda manu.

Nec procul his domini surgunt palatia, Regis
Non semel hospitio nobilitata sui.

Haec terris monumenta dedit Tolchonus‚ et inter
Has operum moles crescere vidit opes. 10

Quantulus, exuvias si spectas corporis, alti
Si pensas animi munera, quantus homo est!

Tolquhc'm.] In Formartine of Aberdeenshire, in the parish os Tarves 3 now a ruin,
but an old seat of a family of ForbeS, whence have branched out the Forbeses of Culloden,
Foveran and many others. Mary Forbes, youngest daughter of Tolquhc'm, was wife to Sir
John Gordon, first Batonet of Haddo (the victirn of “ Haddo's Hole ⁷'), executed in Edinburgh,
1644, and mother to George, first Earl of Aberdeen. On this Tolquhbn, who is contemporary
of Arthur Johnston, see Bulloch's Jmncsone, p. 173; CoHections, cta, p. 330, and Spalding's
Trublcs, Ι. p. 9. The first knight-baronet of the Johnston family, viz., Sir George Johnston‚
nephew to Arthur Johnston‚ married Elisabeth, daughter of William Forbes of Tolquhon. Sir
George was in possession of Caskieben from about 1614, and was head of the Johnstons
during the time of Charles 1.‚ so that Arthur Johnston was in a position to be familiarly
acquainted with the relations between the families os Tolquhon and Caskieben. An older
William Forbes os“Tolquh‹')ne'' is referred to in the curious deed of 1582, printed in Col-
lections, Spald. Club, p. 353.
