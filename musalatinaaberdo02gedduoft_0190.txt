102 EPIGRAMMATA.

8. ARGYLL.

This, the eccentric Archibald [Campbell],l seventh Earl of Argyll, of whom some ac-
count has been given in note under No. LXXIV. He died in 1638, and therefore aster the
publication of the Dch'tiae. See R. Chambers, D. A.. Ι. 500, and Lectus, temp. James VI.
(Abb. CL), pp. 312, 335. Sir R. Douglas (Peerage) quotes the two lines of Arthur Johnston,
and speaks of them as an ‘⁴ expostulation addressed to his Lordship''. It is concerniug this
earl, who lost the Battle of Glenlivet, that Elizabeth addressed a stinging rebuke to King
James as to ‘⁵ glorifying too high and too suddenly a boy of years and conduct’ss (Lcttcrs ⁰f
Elizabcth and Jamcs VI„ Camd. Soc., p. 108). Further glimpse of him in Doncaster’s
Letters (Relati0n os England to Germany, p. 103).

Seeing, Canipbell‚ you have at horne a revenue without bound, and with all
distinction, why hunt for titles and wealth in foreign lands?

Δ 8. ARGATHELIUS.

Cum, Cambelle‚ domi census sine fine decusque
Sit tibi, cur titulos quaeris opesque foris?

Foris] In Spain and Flanders namely, where Argyll took service under Philip 111.
In Brussels Doncaster (himself a Scotsman and envoy of King James) reports that Argyll
wished to pay a visit of respect “without my trouble‚'' and Doncaster returned this rough
answer, ⁶· that it would be a trouble to me to see him at any time, though it were by rencontre;
that, for other meeting‚ I would give him none, and then shun him too as hc did his country ”
(eamd. Soc. as above); a curious coincidence of sentiment with Johnston's expostulation. So
Trumbull reports of him from Brussels in 1619: “The Earl of Argyll‚ decryed and scorned
at home for his weakness, is here [Brussels] carressed beyond the bounds of reason ι gratifyed
with an annual pension of 1500 li. sterling3 and now permitted to repaire into Spaine, where
he is to meet the Conde de Gondomar, the Sinon of our fatherlande, and to treate for the
command of a regiment '⁷. Lettcrs, etc„ as to England and Gcrmcmy (Camd. Soc.). In recent
Heraldic Exhibition Edinburgh (1891), No. 265 in catalogue, was a Letter Patent by Philip IV.
of Spain, of date 27th October, 1627, consen-ing the Order of the Golden Fleece on this Archi-
bald, seventh Earl of Argyll.

9. ERROL.

William [Hay]‚ ninth Earl of Errol‚ became earl in 1631, attended the coronation of
Charles at Edinburgh in 1633 (Misc.‚ Sp. ct, 11. p. cv.), and died in 1636. He had a Douglas
as his mother, viz„ Lady Elizabeth‚ daughter of Wm.‚ Sixth Earl of Morton. His sister was
the ill-fated Sophia, Viscountess os Melgum, of whom see No. XLIX. Her brother was

eager in seeking to bring the perpetrators os the Frendraught tragedy to justice (Spalding's
Trnbles, 1. 19).
