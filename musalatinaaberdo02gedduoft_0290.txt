2. ON THE SAME LADY.

When sleep had stolen over her, the framework of her couch, through
some strange hap not long ago, gave way, and Eliza tumbled out. Close to
her chamber stood Paris, the arbiter of beauty, and grouped around him were
Venus, Juno‚ and Minerva. The Shepherd with the apple in his hand, the
moment he saw Eliza undressed, exclaimed: “ She, she alone deserves beauty’s
pr12e“.

2. DE EADEM.

Somnus ut obrepsit lecti compage soluta,
Nescio quo fato, nuper Eliza ruit.

Adstabat thalamo formae Paris arbiter, illi
Cingebant Cypris, Iuno, Minerva latus.

Poma ferens pastOr, nudam cum vidit Elizam‚
Haec formae pretium sola meretur, ait.

3. ON THE SAME LADY.

The jointed framework of her couch gave way, and all of a heap the
Nymph of Tillyfourl fell, smothered almost in feathers. Her maid-servants
saw the mischief‚ but not one was seen to mourn or tear their bloodless cheeks.
The sole creatures that mourned their mistress were the pups she had reared,
and pitiful was their whining mixed with tearS. Hence learn, ye mortals‚
what poor fidelity is in girls, what leal fidelity dwells in whelps.

3. DE EADEM.

Cardine luxato thalami, Tilifuria Nympha
Corruit, et plumis pene sepulta fuit.
Spectavere nefas famulae, sed plangere nullam
Vidimus, exsangues vel laniare genas.
Quos aluit soli dominam luxere catelli,
Et iunctum lacrimis flebile murmur erat:
Discite mortales, quam sit male firma puellis,
Et quam sit catulis intemerata fides.

“ own chapel ”. Spalding Trubks, Ι. 357.
