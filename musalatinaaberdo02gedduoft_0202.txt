CXVI. AD D. RICHARDUM METELLANUM.

Aurea dent alii, quae, Metellane, mereris
Munera, dent Tyrio coccina tincta cado.
Sunt mera verba mihi sine re, sine pondere voceS,
Et numeri, sed nil, quod numerare queas,
Accipe Ionstono vetus hospes ab hospite nugas,
Munera muneribus non satis aequa tuis.
Tu Cereris, memini, tu Bacchi dona dedisti,
Nil ego Pierias adfero praeter aquas,
Sic aes vile tuo dum muto callidus auro,
Par Diomedis ego, tu mihi Glaucus eris. 10

4. Numeri.] The “poeti'c numbers‚'' of no account in banker's reckoning.
10. Par Diomedis] Allusion to semi-comio incident in Iliad, VI. 236.

1. ΟΝ DANIEL 'fILEN’S DWELLING-HOUSE.

Daniel Tilen, the tutor of the great Turenne, called himself “ Silesius‚” ¹ being a native of
Silesia. He was a Professor os Theology with Arminian tendencies at Sedan, author of
numerous controversial works in Latin with dates between 1605 and 1622, and a familiar
friend of both Arthur and William jolinston. He figures in the ‘⁴ Amica Collatio'' (published
1622), or “ Friendly Conference on Grace and Free Will,'’ held between him and the famous
Scottish scholar and theologiam Cmncro, i.c., John Cameron, who was the Calvinist professor
at Saumur. As early as 1612 we find Dr. Donne writing from Paris (VVorks, Vol. VI. p. 363)
about “ certain opinions of Tilenus, a divine of Sedan, with which the churches of Franee are
scandalised'’. Tilenus, with a view to ingratiate himself with King James, made an attack
on the Scottish Presbyterians in his Paracncsis ad Scotos, Lond. 1620. In 1622 appeared a
reply [by Sempill] to the Pciracnesz's os Tilenus, entitled Scutc' τοῦ τυχόντος Paraclesis. In the
preface the writer complains of Tilenus’s censores on his countrymen‚ and asks (alluding to
the Scottish thistle)‚ “si pungentes repungere Scotis non liceat ''. The relation of Tilen to
Andr-ew Melville and to Sir James Sempill is well stated in James Paterson's Poems ⁰f the
Sempills ⁰s Beltrees, p. xxxvi„ Edinb. 1849. Tilenus had ultimately to leave Sedan because
of his later anti-Calvinistic opinions. See compliment to Tilen as a preceptor in No. XXXVI.

¹A Georgius Tilenus, Silesius, is among the versifiers in the Deliciae Poet. Germanorum,
1612.
