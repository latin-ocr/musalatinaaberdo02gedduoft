10. ART OF DANCING.

often (as in No. CXXIV.‚ 2, and in Sir John Davies' fanciful poem ‘⁵ Orchestra '‘) has
the dance been deemed an imitation of the motion of the heavenly bodies, and the moving
atoms of the ballroom do, in a form, suggest, in its Epicurean and in its social sense, the
“ world '’. It may be doubted, however, whether (even in Tom Moore (Poems, IV., p. 319), or
in Soarne Jenyns‘ charming lines in his “ Art of Dancing,'' beginning: “ Where can philoso-
phers and sages wise‚ Who read the curious volumes of the skies,’' etc.), this notion has ever
been presented in happier form than in this little snatch of Johnston.'

Behold our canopy the sky, which to all ministers their destiny3 in your
mind’s eye survey the quires of stars. At one time they speed fast, anon they
move slow: at another they seem to stand still, and now again to move back-
wards fitfully. They part, unite3 they sink and rise aloft, as moved,I wot,
by the pecten of the etherea} lyre. Here now take a look of the quires of
youths, and you rnay presume that here the stars have either given or gotten the
lesson of their own airy motions.¹

10. SALTATRIX.

Adspice, quo tegimur, caelum, quae fata ministrant
Omnibus: astrorum mente revolve choros.

Nunc properant, nunc lenta meant, nunc stare putantur
Sidera, retrorsum nunc trepidare vides.

Dissiliunt, coeunt, sidunt, tolluntur in altum, 5
Scilicet aethereae pectine mota lyrae.

Hic iuvenum specta choreas, et sidera gyros
Hic docuisse suos, vel didicisse, putes.
