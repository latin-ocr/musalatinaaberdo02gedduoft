XX MEMOIR oF ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

nuptials of Elector Palatine‚ in 1613, with the English princess Elizabeth,
who had been born in Scotland. The Elector Palatine was a nephew of the
Duc de Βο11111011, Prince of Sectam, while the Elector's younger brother Ludwig
—brother-in—law therefore to the princess—was among the students at Sedan.
(See No. XXXVI., a poem which must fall in the years between 1613 and
1619.) “

111 1619 1116 131651 entry is found connecting him with Sedan. In that
year he was charged with the duty of investigating the qualifications of a
compatriot fora Chair in Sedan. The abbe relates the matter thus: “En
16191e docteur Jonston fut charge par le conseil des moderateurS, de juger
de 13 capacite d'Alexandre Colvin‚ Ecossais, qui postulait les chaires de
physique et d'Hebreu a l'Acade'mie de Sedan. Depuis cette e'poque, l'on ne
voit plus son nom dans les fastes de cette academie. Neanmoins il est tres
probable qu'il ne quitta Sedan que vers 1623‚1 car on sait qu'il avait habite
France pendant vingt ans, et rien n'indique qu'il ait transfere son domicile
dans aucune autre ville de ce royaume.'’

Toward the close of the Sedan period he commences author, and is found
publishing the early productions ofhis Μ1156.2 These were at first anonymous,
though afterwards acknowledged; the poem No. IV. in our series in Vol. I. is
printed at Paris and Edinburgh in 1619, and No. V. appears at Paris in 1620,
both of them dealing with the attack on Buchanan by Eglishem, and con-
sisting of a pair of satires on the malignes of the great literary Scotchman.
Somewhere before this time must be placed the incident, no doubt magni-
fied, if not largely invented, by Sir Thomas Urquhart‚ viz„ Johnston’s
laureation at Paris as having gained the prize for poetry before finishing his
23rd year.²⁵ According to the usual date given hitherto for 1115 birth, this
would fall about the year 1610, but the judgment must be suspended until
more evidence for the fact itself 15 available.

From Heidelberg issued the next productions of his Muse, consisting of
the brilliant series of poems (Nos, VL-VIII.) intended to stir up feeling as to
the falling fortunes of the Elector Palatine in the Bohemian struggle. As a
Protestant manifesto, these poems would have been scarcely welcome at a
Paris printing press, and he therefore turned to the early city of his sojourn,

Philosophicae sub praesidio Arturi Jonstoni propugnatae’. Sedan, 1605 and 6, in 4t0.
These being in prose, and not necessarily by Johnston, may be lest out os view.
