EPIGRAMS. 161

2. ON THE SAME.

Chai-les, while in eagerness for the chase you tend northward in burning
zeal, you turn your royal back to the south. At once Orion, cloud-compelling,
frowns in the sky, and Auster pours unseasonable floods. Deem not these

rains to be sprung from spongy clouds: regard them as the sky's own tears,
weeping because you run away.

2. DE EADEM.

Carole, venandi studio dum tendis in Arcton
Fervidus, obvertens regia terga Noto;

Contrahit in caelo frontem nimbosus Orion,
Intempestivas fundit et Auster aquas.

Has tu ne pluvias bibulis e nubibus ortas,
Sed lacrimas caeli, quod fugiS, esse puta.

3. ΟΝ THE SAME.

The King put off the journey ᾖε had projected to the northern regions,
when, O floods, ye fell from the sky. At once he broke off his march, when
he saw the clouds come gathering under frost and snows shed from a frosty
sky. To the Powers on high he yielded obedience: do you, O Britain, take a
lesson to observe the nod ofyour higher Power.

3. DE EADEM.

Rex iter, Arctoas quod erat molitus in oras,
Distulit, e caelo cum cecidistis aquae.

Mox iter abrupit, cogi curn frigore nubes,
Et gelido fundi vidit ab axe nives.

Praebuit obsequium 'Superis3 hinc discito nutus

Observare tui, terra Britanna, Iovis.
