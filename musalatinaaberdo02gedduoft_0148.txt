XCII. TO THOMAS HOPE, KING'S ADVOCATE,

This famous lawyer, known as Sir Thomas Hope of Craighall (in Fife), was a con-
spicuous figure in the early days of the Covenant‚ which movement he favoured. Hence
Robert Baillie (ΙΙΙ. p. 68) styles him the ‘⁴ Good Advocate ”. In 1608 a payment is made to
him for ‘⁸ persute of the townis [Aberdeen] actioun befoir the lordis '' (Misc. spald. Club, V.
p. 136; see also the cluster of lawyers in Spalding, Trubles, ΙΙ, 7, 259; Sir Al. Grant's Story,
cta, II. 186). A diary‚ not very interesting, which Hope kept, has been published by the
Bannatyne Club, and a portrait of him exists at Hopetoun, painted by Jamesone (Bulloch's
Jamcsonc, p. 94). Glimpses of him are got in the Correspondcnce of Earls ofAncram, etc. ,-

was appointed King's Adyocate in 1617, and again in 16273 Advocate for life in 1641; and
was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church in 1643, the last and
only commoncr who has held that dignity. Died in 1646.

ARGUMENT.

Greatest of the sons of Phoebus, foreniost boast of the great Council,
sharp file of the forum, hail, O Hope, greater than these titles three. In
attending to the king’s rights, protect likewise his servitor, in charge of thy
master's life and health. Like a lynx’s eye is thy mind, sweeter than nectar
is thy tongue, spotless thy breast and whiter than snow. Graces are in thy
countenance, Hope is in thy name, and gifts that others have in scattered
form thou hast together. Put forth thy virtues, fulfilling the promise of
thy name, and prove to Johnston what a strong man thou art.
