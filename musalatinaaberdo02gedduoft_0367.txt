ENCOMIA URBIUM. 271

14. FoRFAR.

Forfar, thy pride is in the remains ofa royal palace, a lake, and fertile
country round. With narrow burghal territory, thou art acknowledged queen
of Angus, and rural glens remote own thy courts oflaw. While the bailies
dispense justice, the folk is busy at its trades, preparing leather from skins of
fat bullocks, and cordovan to cover the feet of maidens. Sandals for Italians
and slippers for Franciscans thou suppliest‚ and boots 01· brogues are prepared
by thee, a fence to country people against ice and snow. 'Twas with such
greaves the old Achaeans were armed, and the tragie buskin and the comic
sock was an invention of the same rustic folk. Let Rome and Sparta both
veil their pride. leey put a yoke upon a people's necks ; Forfar shackles feet
and legs obedient to her sway.
