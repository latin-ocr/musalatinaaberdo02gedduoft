APPENDIX IV.
REFERENCES TO ENCOMIA ΟΝ ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

See Prefaee to Delphin Edition of Arturi Ionstoni Psalmi Davidici
London, 1741, where appear Ten citations in prose and Latin verse,
from various authors in praise ofJohnston. Add those in Latin verse
by Dr. Geo. Sibbald of Rankeillour, by Rev. Andrew Ramsay, and
Professor John Ker (pp. xlix„ li.‚ and lxiii. of Lauder's Musae Sacrae,
1739). From his friend, David Wedderburn, we have the tribute in
Del„ 11., p. 554: “ Hinc Ionstonus opem confert, quo se hospite
Olympus Nunc iactat, quondam Pindus,'’ as also his Epistola (Del.,
11.‚ p. 573), ending with “Phoebus Unus semper eras, tu mihi
semper eris''. In Ruddiman’s Vindication (p. 229) the verdict of a
Dutch scholar, Gutherleth of Lewarden (Leovardia). Bishop Lowth
(sacred Poetry of tlte Hebrews) refers to Johnston’s version of Psalm
XLII., and Dr. Beattie compares the merits ofJohnston and Buchanan
fflissertatiom, Moral and Criticczl‚ 4²⁰ edition, p. 645). The only ones
have room to cite in full are three : one from the present century, from
the pen of the Aberdonian Historian of Scotland‚ whose somewhat
aeid deliverance regarding him must however be taken with some
modifying salt, the remarkable one from a critic of Johnston's own
century, the learned Dane, Olaus Borrichius, and the eulogium from
his contemporary and countryman, Regent and Professor in King’s
College, A. Strachan, in his Panegyricus Inauguralis. We take

them in their historical order.
