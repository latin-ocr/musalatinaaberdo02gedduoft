3. LINLITHGOW (LITHGOW IN J. BARCLAY).

A noble town Linlithgow is, with its church of sumptuous stone and its
turreted royal palaee of like splendour. A lake, by no wall confined, adjoins‚
in whose pure depths the scaly tribes disport, and whence triumphal banquets
are drawn for the Scottish soldier. The Roman Caesar had his luxurious
Lucrine lake; this yields more of joyous food.

3. LIMNUCHUM.

Nobile Limnuchum est ;- Pario de marmore templum
Hic nitet, impensae non mediocris opus.
Aemula sunt templi turrita palatia Regis,
Et pretio superant solis utramque domum.
Proximus est urbi nullo lacus aggere cinctus,
Squamiger illimes grex natat inter aquas,
Ista triumphales praebent vivaria cenas,
Grampiaco quoties sub Iove miles ovat.
Regius hic lacus est, Lucrinus Caesaris unda:
Plus habet hic luxus, plus habet ille dapis. 10

4. sT1RL1NG.

An epigram thereon of John Johnston is in Dr. G. Maekenzie’s Lives, ΙΙ. p. 404.

Who can sing of Stirling worthily? ’Tis the cradle of kings, which they
placed secure upon its lofty ridge. Healthful air surrounds this palaee on the
twin rocks, as proud as the dwelling of Tarpeian Jove. Here the Forth
receives the yoke of two triumphal arches, and weaves its majestic windings
like Maeander in the Asiatic world. Town and country here smile with
fruitful happiness, but the martial fame of the place is still more surpassing.
Stirling more than once repelled the Ausonian [Roman] spear, and the stream
adjoining was the limit of the Imperial Eagle.
