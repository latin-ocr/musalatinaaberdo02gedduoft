EPIGRAMS. 145

4. AsTRoNOMY.

Astraea now returnS, and leaving her celestial seats enters your realrns,
O Charles, which are blest by you with peace. Rightly the virgin reappearing
places herselfunder the king's wings, who is peerless in the world for worth and
equity. Rightly she hath left the heaven: since your merits mount to the
stars, she counts yon more worthy of these abodes. Worthy though you be
thereof‚ yet the virgin Astraea and all the earth beseech heaven suppliantly that
it may be long ere you ascend to those high abodes.

4. ASTRONOMIA.

Nunc redit, et superos linquens Astraea penates,
Quae tu pace beas, Carole‚ regna subit.
Iure redux virgo Regis se subiicit alis,
Quo melius, quo nil aequius orbis habet.
Iure polum liquit: meritis cum sidera tangas, 5
Te magis his dignum iudicat illa locis.
Sis licet his dignus, tamen haec te scandere sero
Virgo rogat suppleX‚ totaque terra Deos.

3. Virgo] i.e.‚ Astraea, the goddess of Justice.

5. GEOMETRY.

My compass measures the mighty world, and whatsoever meets the eye
in sea or shore; in scales are weighed the masses of sea and the vast earth
and the buried realm of Dis. Yet great Heaven has given you, O Chanes,
realms too small, and the earth is too narrow for your throne. Democritus,
who of old imagined countless worlds, would say they could be ruled with

only you as Jove supreme.

5. GEOMETRIA.

Dum meus immensum metitur circinus orbem,
Inque solo quicquid cernitur, inque salo: 10
Dum maris et vastae trutinantur pondera terrae,
Et quidquid Ditis regna sepulta tenent:
Parva tibi nimium Di magni regna dederunt,
Et minor est solio, Carole‚ terra tuo.
Qui prius innumeros finxit Democritus orbes,

Diceret hos uno te Iove posse regi.
