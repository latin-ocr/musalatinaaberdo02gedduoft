8. DE EIUSDEM LAPSU EX EQUO.

Laedere Gordonum lapsu qui nequiteraudes,
Quid tibi non optem, saeve caballe, mali?

Exue cum freno phaleras et ephippia, tergum
Nemo paret strigili comere, nemo iubam.

Indue clitellas posthac et iunctus asello
Verte molam, plaustrum vel trahe, more bovis.

Non potes armenti generosi pullus haberi,
Bellua, tardigradi gloria prima gregis.

Non iuga te Scythiae, non te tulit Africa tellus,
Nec quae nobilibus claruit, Astur, equis. 10

Ditis equi, Nycteus, Aethon, Orphnaeus, Alastor,
Ad vada Tartarei te genuere lacus.

Pegasus excusso domino conscendit Olympum,
Ad stabulum Stygii te decet ire Iovis.

9. ΤΟ THE SAME, ΟΝ THE FIRST OF JANUARY.
(Cf. infra, and for similar strain Vol. I., No. XI.)

On Janus’ sacred morn, whoever claims offerings from Johnston, ploughs
the strand with unavailing heifers. The Deity we poets worship is rich in
silver and gold, grandes and more splendid than even Jove. His sheen is
golden3 his house of gold sparkles with gems, the like of which the wave of
the Eastern Sea never knows. He turns and winds his golden-maned coursers
in his ruddy car, and, himself all golden, directs his gilded wheels. Gold too
is what is champed by his steeds‚ as is witnessed by the flames that consumed
thee, O Phaethon. ’Tis on ambrosia and pure nectar that this breed subsists
—food such as regales the whole celestial band, not excepting Jove. Alack for
me, the votaries of Phoebus have lurid looks: they are kept down by sore
famine and by pov„erty. Farewell, Phoebus; score out of thy records an old
dependent: I am loath to pay vows to an ungrateful God. Incense hereafter
I’ll bring and fall down at Gordon’s shrine; he shall be, under great Jove, my
protecting Power. I am not afraid that he will behave like my former master
and sin after thy example. One ground there is of fear, he too cultivates the

Muses; and the same infirmity that keeps his brethren down, perhaps affects
him as well.
