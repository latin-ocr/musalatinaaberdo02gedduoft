274 ENCOMIA URBIUM.

⁷ 16. MoNTROSE.

Epigram thereon by John Johnston in Dr. G. Mackenzie's Lives, ΙΙ. 425.

The noble town, formerly known as Celurca of celestial affinity, now
rejoices as the Mount of Roses. A hill adjoins by which a river glides: both
supply rich dainties to the people: salmon and whatever Nero’s ponds can
yield come from the waters, choice cattle from the hill. The banks are
fringed with lilies, refreshing to the eye, and the heights around glow with red
roses. Eastward is the tributary sea, enlivened by countless sails. The
Links form the playground of the people‚ where some youths practise horse-
manship, some archery, others the “ putting '' ofthe stone with Herculean arm.
Wrestling and quoits are here, and playing at ball with the crooked club. A

glimpse of thy beauties would wean Jove from his Capitol, Venus from her
Idalian haunts.
