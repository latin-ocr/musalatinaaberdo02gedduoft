ARGUMENT.

Tilen's house is cunningly contrived: burnt brick and stone one sees
combined. WVhen the crack of doom eomes the house will stand amid an
empty world. Corne flood, come fire, it is safe.

CXVII. A. LUSUS AMOEssAEI.

1. DE AEDIBUS DAN. TILENI.

Daedala Tilenus molitur tecta, recoctos
Hic lateres, illie surgere saxa vides.

Cum dabit exitio terras regnator Olympi,
Haec erit, et vacuo stabit in orbe domus.

Unda licet flammaeque ruant, secura pericli est: 5
Altera pars flammas, altera ridet aquas.

2. PALINODE.

This is Tilen's house: of stone, one part, of brick well baked, the other3
stranger, withdraw. The owner's name and fame will last for aye, but, I fear,
not so the house; it will perish. Corne fire, come flood, it will collapse: one
half will yield to flame, the other dissolve in flood.

2 . PALINODIA.

Tileni haec domus est, saxis pars altera, muris

Altera coctilibus tollitur; hospes abi.
Aeternum vivet domini nomenque decusque3

Sed vereor cito ne sit peritura domus. 10
Sive ignis, sive unda ruat, dabit illa ruinam ;

Altera pars flammis, altera cedet aquiS.
