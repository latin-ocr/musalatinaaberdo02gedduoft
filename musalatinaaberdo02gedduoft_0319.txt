PARERGA (SUPPLEMENT). 223

CLIV. 1. COMPLAINT OF LADY ANNE GORDON⁷S
PET PARROT.

This is the first of a triad of similar jenx d'esprit, dealing with domestic pets. These
seem to have been in Johnston's days as necessary a part of a happy household as they are
found to be at the present day. There is much humour in the mode in which their rival
claims are presented and domestic peace is supposed to be maintained.

ARGUMENT.

Why boast Ι of plumage fair as yon green emerald on my lady's finger ?
Raven black becomes me more. Ι have no longer my mistress' favour.
Lately I was sole favourite‚ now there is a puppy in the hall, and a pussy
snores in my lady's rosy lap. Such is the inconstancy even in celestial
minds. All the gods have each their favourite bird, but you, with regal
origin reaching up to the godS‚ discard your favourite bird, and for what Ρ-
a dog. Alas‚ what have I done to merit this ? I was born in India, and arn
now living beneath the cold pole, a prisoner in a brazen cage. In my native
haunts Ι had companionship; here Ι can have neither sponse nor offspring.
Why all my training to utter pleasant accentS, to greet my lady with “ Good-
morning'’? Then again, dogs are vile creatures‚ and have done terrible things.
They tore their own master Actaeon, and the great Euripides died by their
fangs; as also the captain of the Cynic band. Cerberus is their sire, and
they are obscene and lustful. Rome drave them from her forum. So do you,
and expel them from your thresholds.

CLIV. 1. QUERELA PSITTACI, QUEM ANNA GORDONIA
MARCHIONIS HUNTLAEI FILIA IN DELICIIS HABUIT.

Cur ego veste tegor, virides imitante smaragdos,
Tu quibus articulos cingere, virgo, soles?
Cur nitet et minio cervix variatur Ibero?
Coccina cur teneros velat aluta pedes ?
Talia felices quaerant pigmenta volucres,
Quae male constanti non famulantur herae.
Cornicis po'tius vel corvi sumere plumas
Me decet ; afflictis convenit ille color.
