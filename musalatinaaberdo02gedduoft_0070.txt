6 EPIGRAMMATA.

4. BEASTS OF THE CHASE.

In gold and Tyrian silk glisten droves of wild beasts, portrayed by the
needle of a Scottish nymph. Here an Umbrian Hound pants after a Hare;
there lies a Boar with many a wound. A Stag at bay tosses the Dogs into
the air. Chamois and Roedeer with gasping Hounds in hot pursuit; nor are
wanting the Lion and Bears, the shaggy Bison and the striped Tiger, all with
huntsmen and nets and weapons congregated round. ’Tis a scene where
the hunter’s queen may learn her own craft, and Minerva get lessons vin her
own art.

5. BIRDS.

The feathered tribes are seen in pictured form, the gifts of Minerva’s
art, at Lethington. There is the Phoenix, born on her funeral pile; the
Eagle snatching up a hare, which piteously from the sky appeals for human help.
The Junonian bird spreads her resplendence in the sun, and with flashing
necks the Doves of Venus bill and coo. There, too, is the Swan whiter than
snow, the Parrot with green wings, the warrior Chanticleers, the Nightingale
within its poplar shade. The Crane 111 combat with the Pygmy, the Halcyon
in quest of its 1nate3 the Goose, once guardian of the Capitol, and the bird
that came from the Phasian stream, the Pelican and the Stork, are there.
Untie the threads that bind thern, and the creatureS‚ you would be hail, would
fly in air.

6. FISHEs.

The scaIy, finny tribes, and all life marine, our fair nymph here displays.
The Whale spouts showers of 1111118,- 1118 Orc plunges his prong into the
Whale’s side. There the Dolphin sports and wantons, and the Phoca
wallows; the Cuttlefish blackens the waters, and the Mullet buries its
mouth for concealment. Octopuses‚ Lobsters‚ Conger Eels are fighting there.
There too 18 1118 Ν3ι1111118, bark and sail, steersman and passenger all in
one. There too the Crocodile shedding tears, the Hippopotamus bleeding
itself on a pointed reed, and all the rest—of all forms, hues and colours.
Chief, the Salmon with 1118 silver shoulders. The Siren too 18 111818, and
Tethys with her sponse, and Triton with his conch for trumpet, amid
Naiads and Nereids in the throng. The youths of old Rome delighted in
their puny fish-ponds : here you behold the whole realm of Amphitrite.

7. THE PLANETS.

Behold how, leaving the lower world, the nymph portrays with daedal
hand the powers of heaven ! There stands saturn with his hook, Jove with
his levin-bolts, Mars with his shield, Phoebus having his countenance orbed
