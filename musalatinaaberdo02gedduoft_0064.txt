lvi APPENDIX.

Robert Wilkinson‚ No. 58 Cornhill‚ faces the biographical sketch of Arthur
Johnston in the Iconogmphia scotica, byJohn Smith of the Inner Temple,
London [1798] ; but by what appears to have been a careless mist-ake, the
name inscribed beneath the picture is “John Johnstone‚ M.D.⁷’. Another en-
graving from the same picture, published 1 Dec. 1798, by Edward Harding‚
98 Pall Man, is in Pinkerton's Scotish Gallery, London: 1799. A copy of
this engraving is in the portrait serap book belonging to the Royal College of
Physicians of Edinburgh.

The Marischal College painffing, a photogravure of which appears in this
volume, is mentioned at page 123 of Bulloch's George Jamesone. It is
inscribed ‘⁶ 1621, Aetat 42 ⁷³. A copy of this painting (not the King’s College
one, as erroneously stated by Mr. Bulloch) done in oil‚ by wales, for the Earl
of Buchan, is in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Another
copy, painted in 1837 for the late Mr. Alexander Johnston‚ W.S., by john
Henry of Edinburgh, is in the pOssession of the writer.

55. The engraved portraits ofJohnston, contained in his Poemata Omnia
and in two editions of the Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacrae, are mentioned
under Nos. 15, 21 and 23. These cannot be said to bear much resemblance
to either of the paintings now extant. The frontispiece of the Poemata Omnia
is shewn in one of the glass cases in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

56. There are two engravings ofJohnston taken by John Michel Rysbrack,
frorn a bust which belonged to Mt. Auditor Benson. One, engraved by G.
Vertue in 1740, which is in the quarto edition ofJohnston’s Psalms, published
in 1741, is mentioned at No. 26, and the other, by VanderGucht‚ 1740, which
is in the octavo edition of 1741, is referred to at No. 27. A copy of the
former is in the Scottish National Portrait GaHery, and another is in the por-
trait serap book of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. There is
a woodcut taken from it in Anderson's Scottish Ναΐὶοη, 1868, Vol. ΙΙ., p. 577.

57. One of the lights of the window, known as the Melvin Window‚ at
the east end of the Library of the University of Aberdeen, represents Arthur
johnstom the likeness having been taken from the King’s College portrait.
An illustration and description of this window is given in James Melvin, a
sketch by David Masson. Aberdeen 1895. See also p. 528, Fasti Academioe
Mariscallanae Aberdonensis. New Spalding Club. Aberdeen 1889. The
first named book was edited, and the latter written, by Mr. P. J. Anderson,
Secretary of the Club, and Librarian to the University of Aberdeen, to whom
I am much indebted for valuable assistance in the preparation of this

bibliography. ἲ
