ARGUMENT.

Tolquhon, When he had made his house rich with offspring and lands,
worn out with age, quitted the world without a sigh. This tomb he formed,
calmly expecting his' latest day. Near by are seen the fields2 he devoted to
the poor, and also the inviolable temples of his rearing. Not far off rise the
lord's mansions‚ that have more than once entertained royalty. Such are
Tolquhon’s memorials, and amid these big creations he saw his resources
grow. How poor a thing is man, if you look to the body's mortal coil; bin,
if you weigh the endowments of his mind so deep, how great he is !

¹ Pronounced with accent on last, like Colquhosm = To-hoim.

2 Alluding to an “ hospital ” sor poor men which he founded and endowed (Collecti0ns,
spald. Club, p. 330).
