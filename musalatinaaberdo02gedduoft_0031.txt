MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JonNsToni xxiii

wished to see a rival star enter the firmament as a translator of the Psalms
to compete in lustre with the obnoxious Buchanan.

The only important event in his subsequent lilemry life which we are
able to refer to a specific date, is the publication of the Delitiae Poetarum
Scotorum in the year 1637.1 His friend John Scot of Scotstarvet brought out
this work, which was published at Amsterdam‚ and Johnston seems not only
to have contributed largely to the poems-more extensively‚ indeed, than any
other single writer—but to have interested himself deeply in its progress.
Hence the Dedicatory Letter of Thanks to Scotstarvet with which it openS‚
and which is a specimen of Latin prose from the pen of Johnston (Vol. 1.,
p. 6); as also the prefatory elogia in verse (shira, p. 10). In this regard it is
interesting to note the strong links of connection binding these two scholars
in a league of friendship, Through the influence no doubt of Johnston, Scot
is honoured by becoming a burgess οῑῑῗ Aberdeen (p. 4 of Vol. Ι.) ; and Scot
repays the compliment by introducing Johnston to the cultured society of
Hawthornden, the residence of his brother-in-law‚ william Drummond.
Scotstarvet has left it on record that ‘nis own love was for the elegiae muse ;
that, like Milton, he preferred Ovid (Delitiae, IL, p. 488) to all the other Latin
poetS, and, this being so, he must have rejoiced in the friendship ofjohnst0n‚
whose works are almost uniformly in that species of verse, and so form a
remarkable monument of the elegiae muse.

About the same year came the high academie honour which he received
of being elected Rector of the University and King's College of Aberdeen.
This took place on the 24th ofJune, 1637, a period which may be described as
the Augustan time of Aberdonian learning :inde—r the remarkable efflorescence 2
of talent educed by the genial sway in matters academie of Bishop Patriek
Forbes. The post, though honourable, was arduouS, and the questions con-
* fronting a high official such as the Rector at that stormy time as to the
charter and interna] constitution of the University are seen to have been of
a thorny and eontentious nature.³² (See Fasti Aberdonenses of Cosmo Innes
for that period.)

The curtain, however, is soon to fall upon Johnston's career. In 1641,

¹ It is in two small volumes and is in imitation of the Delitiae Poet. Germanorum, 1612,
which again was in imitation of Delitiac Post. Italorum, 1608. Dr. Samuel Johnson was
forced to give a certain meed of praise to Scotland sor the Delitias and for Masson‘s Drummond,

³An interesting entry is the characteristic addition made by him to the University
Library of a Copy of (ialen in several volumes (Fasti Alaeus„ p. 409).
