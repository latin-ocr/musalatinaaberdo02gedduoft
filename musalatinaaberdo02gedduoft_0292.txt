CXLI. ON THE DEATH OF MR. DAVID BALLANTYNE
OF KINNOCHAR, CLERGYMAN.

A relation of Adam Ballantyne or Bellenden, Bishop of Aberdeen (see No. CXV. 9), as
appears from the following extract from illustrations to Row's History, p. 260: “ Mr. Adam
Balledyn‚ laird of Kilconquhar or Ken-na-where'⁷ (alluding to the popular pronunciation of
the estate, ‘⁶ Kinneuchar ''). See also Calderwood, H. of Ch„ 7155.

ARGUMENT.

By the fatal scythe Ballantyne has fallen, on the eve of closing six half
decades of time with rapid wheels. In him perished at the same time true
Piety and aught of Honour and Candour remaining in the world. The Graces
have fied, and the arts of Pallas, and the cultured accomplishment of weighty
Eloquence. His wealth he left to others, but his paternal virtues, which he
cherished, he has carried away with him to the stars. Be it men or Gods,
O cruel Death‚ thou meanest to aim at, henceforth rage against all or any at
thy will. Wield promiscuously the fatal brand, and toss grimly everywhere
funereal torches. The darling of mankind thou, abominable wretch‚ hast
torn away; the force of cruelty can no further gO.

CXLI. IN OBITUM M. DAVIDIS BALANTINI DE
KINNOCHAR, ECCLESIASTAE.

Falce Balantinus fatali concidit, aevi
Sex properans rapidis claudere lustra rotis.
Vera simul periit pietas et quidquid honesti,
Quidquid et ingenuae mentis in orbe fuit.
Fugerunt Charites, fugerunt Palladis artes,
Cultus et eloquii cum gravitate nitor.
Liquit opes aliis: virtutes ille paternas,
Quas coluit, secum vectus in astra tulit.
In quoscunque lubet posthac, Mors improba, saevi,
Sive paras homines figere, sive Deos. 10
Utere fatali nullo discrimine ferro,
Et quate funereas tristis ubique faces.
Delicias hominum rapuisti, pessima rerum:
Ulterius feritas tendere nulla potest.
