ON TAURELLUS'S MONKEY. 55

LXXXIV. ΟΝ TAURELLUS'S MONKEY.

This sashion of apes as pets was not uncornmon in that age. Goethe’s explanation of
it is interesting (Eckerman’s conversations, I. 427). Even in her sorrow& the Princess
Elizabeth of Bohemia so amused herself(Green’s Livcs of Prhzcesses, V. 288).

ARGUMENT.

Great Alexander and pious Augustus each dropt a tear over a dead
steed. Egyptians mourned a crow, the Romans a raven, and Atalanta
blushed not to weep over her dog. In Taurellus's breast, affection was no
less strong: a monkey's winding-sheet proved a theme for sorrow.

2. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SAME MONKEY.

In life it liked the men, though itself a female, and always disliked
and snarled at the soster sex. Yet 'twas they that wept at its funeral
rites‚ which the men sustained with cheeks all dry. Compare now the
sexes, you eaptious critic: in the one you have the fruit of fine feeling; in
the other, the outcome of inborn fierceness.

3. oN THE SAME.

Once a denizen of the woods, Ι roamed at freedom, but was made to
carry a captive’s dire chains. My human-looking face, my many wrinkles
old, touched not my master, nor yet the fact of my being from a foreign
clime. But, beyond my hope, death bursts my chains. My lord was cruel,
but the Fate was kind.
