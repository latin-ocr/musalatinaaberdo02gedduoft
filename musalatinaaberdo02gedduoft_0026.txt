xviii MEMom OF ARTHUR JoHNsTON.

would no doubt hear of Johnston as a brilliant young Scotch savan who was
well known to the denizens of Heidelberg and the Electoral circle of that city.
Accordingly in the early days of November, 1603, Johnston appears at Sedan
accompanied by his compatri0t‚ also Aberdonian, Walter Donaldson, and on
22nd of that month heis named Regent of the Third Class¹ in the college
then recently created. (See Appendix No. 11.) On 10th July‚ 1604, he is pro-
moted to take direction of the Second Clam, and is named at the same time
Professor of Logic and Metaphysic. In this sphere of duty he is believed to
have passed six years In those six years we can discern only two trans-
actions ofJ0hnst0n to which dates can be assigned. The first takes place on
18th October, 1605, when we find (from a Thesis2 still extant in the Royal
Library in the British Museum) he presided at the delivery of a Philosophical
Thesis defended by a certain young Pole then studying at Sedan.

The other incident at Sedan to which we can assign a date is a dedication
to him of a Thesis by one Abraham Rambour of Sedan on 18th August, 1608.
It was on the theme ‘⁶ Potestas Ecclesiae‚’⁷ and had this flattering inscription
in his honour: ‘⁴ Sapient. doctissimoque viro Dn. Arturo Ionstono‚ meta-
physicae et logicae in ill. Acad. Sedanensi professori lectissimo. Sedan,
1608, 4*⁰.'' The next information we have of his doings at Sedan falls in
the year 1610, when he becomes, on 15th October, Professor not of Meta-
physic but of Physic, and, according to the Abbe Boulliot, his appointment
was in succession to his compatriot Walter Donaldson, who had vacated the
Chair of Physic by being promoted to the principalship of Sedan.

It is in the summer of that year that is placed the interesting event
which is assumed as a certain fact in his biography, viz.‚ his laureation as
a Doctor of Medicine at Padua, and the date is given as ΙΙΙ. Id. Iun.‚ or

¹ In succession to John Cameron, according to Ch. Peyran(H1'stoirc de l’Academie de
Sedan, p. 30).

²The Thesis is printed on silk paper and is embossed on both book-boards with the
Royal Arms. It is dedicated to King James 1., and being sumptuously got up has been care-
fully preserved as among the royal treasures. It formed probably the first introduction of the
name of Arthur Johnston under the notice of his future patron, James Ι. The title page
bears—“Audexexlns Metaphysica de Unitate, Quam Deo ter opt. max. adjuvante Iohan
Bogusz L. B. de Ziemhc, Praeside Arturo Ionstono Scoto-Britone‚ Logicae et Metaphysicae
Professore, in illustri Ducis Bullonii Academia publico Philosophorum examini offert ad diem
xviii. Octobris Anno MDCV. in aula academia hora prima. Sedani. Excudebat Iacobus
Salessus.'' There is a Latin epigram of dedication to James Ι. by Bogusz ‘¹ Polonus,'’ and,
after the Dissertation and Problemata, comes a congratulatory epigram (eight Latin lines) to

Bogusz by D. Tilenus “ Silesius,'' the same Tilenus who occurs frequently in the poems of

Johnston as his literary friend. (See Appendix No. V., § 51.)
