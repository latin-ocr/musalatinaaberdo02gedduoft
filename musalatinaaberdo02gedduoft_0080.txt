LV. TO THE DUC DE LA TREMOUILLE CONCERNING
MARIE DE LA TOUR, HIS SPOUSE.

(Plura, for historica! matter, also under LXXXV.)

The thought in this jeu d’esprit, repeated in LIX„ is parallel to that in Ben Jonson’s
‘⁶ Discourse '⁵ with Cupid :—

“ Couldst thou, Love,

Call to mind the forms that strove She is Venus when she smi1es,

For the apple, and those three But she's Juno when she walks,

Make in one, the same were she. And Minerva when she talks ! ”
ARGU MENT.

Now thou weddest a daughter of De la Tour [i.e., of Bouillon] and
Orange [Nassau]. The gifts held out to Paris, she has them all—Pallas’
talentS, Juno’s wealth, Venus³ fair countenance. Paris would avow she
embodies the whole trio in her single self. Sole difference, that here our
Pallas is soft and bland, our Juno gentle, and our Venus chaste.
