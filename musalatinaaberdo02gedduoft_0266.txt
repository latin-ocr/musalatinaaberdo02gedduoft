174 EPIGRAMMATA.

3. ON THE SAME.

While Gordon was too closely pressing siege at Speyer, he felt a ball from
the citadel pierce his thigh. The same hero, in suing for nuptials with a bride,
finds his heart pierced by Love with Venus⁷ Acidalian shaft. Victor over the
city he returned, and, unless the stars deceive, the Nymph of his ambition will
relent and yield.

3. DE EODEM.

Dum proprius Nemetum premeret Gordonius urbem,

Glande sibi figi sensit ab arce femur.
Dum Nymphae thalamos idem sibi destinat Heros,

Pectus Acidaliae cuspide figit Amor. 4
Urbe triumphata rediit, nisi sidera fallunt,

Porriget et victas Nympha petita manus.

1. Proprius] Misprint in Middelburg Ed. for propius. The historical incident is
found referred to in Wm. Gordon’s History of the Family os Gordon (1727), Vol. IL, p. 164,
but it is the son of the Earl of Enzie‚ not Enzie himself the future second Marquis, who is there
said to have been wounded at Speyer.

4. ON THE RETURN OF THE SAME TO THE CITY.

Spring brings violets‚ summer the golden grain, autumn Bacchus’ bever-
age, grim winter only snows. Why then should it be that the new year begins
in winter time ? what have the frosts, what have the short days done, to deserve
that boon? Now, two-headed JanuS‚ when you seek the initial of the golden
year on the ascending slope, you are a senseless dolt. Winter has got all the

honours, seeing that winter restored thee, thou best of Gordons, to the folks
of Aberdeen.
