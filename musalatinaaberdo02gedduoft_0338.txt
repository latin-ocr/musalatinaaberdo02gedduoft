Ι was neere drownd in griefe with many a teare‚

Now hee is going, griefe doth stint those showres,

For greater then teares is this griefe of ours.

Rex iter Arctoas dum moliretur in oras,

Tota fui lacrimis paene sepulta meis.
Nunc ubi discedit, cessant quos fudimus imbres:
Est maior lacrimis scilicet iste dolor.

Thy wish'd Sunbeam and makes theebsee thy King,

In smiles alone, for all words are farre lesse.
