Grammaticae et Logicae iura tibi atque iuga. 4

12. JOHNSTON.

Your mind has become dazed through your songs, and mine, Tilen, rages
in Bacchanalian fashion. ¹ Such strains Phoebus did not inspire‚ nor the group

my offerings were apples of Mandragora.

12. 10NsT0Nus. .

Carminibus tua facta tuis lymphatica mens est,
Et mea, bacchantum more, Tilene, furit.
Non haec Thymbraeus dictavit carmina vates,
Nec quae Pierias turba propinat aquas.
Aut striges ista tibi dictarunt, aut ego nostra
Munera mandragorae poma fuisse puto. 10

13. TILEN.

Your melon, Johnston‚ disdains my Iacchus, but a true melon is glad to

nor with thee, O Venus, who art cold without both of these powers divine.
Unpleasing melon, get you away from this banquet, from this couch, far away ε
Ι (10 not like your quality. To the pigs begone; away from me, and get about
your business, O melon, henceforth to have no melody from me.
