LXXXVIII. ΟΝ THE DEMISE OF THE DUKE OF LENNOX.

In 1624 Esme Stuart, Duke of Lennox, suddenly died, and this event, followed by the
death of the Marquis of Hamilton, affected as a portent the public mind. See No. IX.‚
ll. 39, 40, of Vol. Ι.

ARGUMENT.

Just as King James is convening Commons and Peers, and all Europe
is a scene of terror, Lennox is swept away by death, the people's hope and
the glory of the Peers. O Heavens! this is more than death—a public
calamity. Stabbed through his bleeding country's side, the victim falls.

LXXXVIII. IN OBITUM DUCIS LENNOXII.

Dum populum proceresque suos Iacobus in unum
Cogit, et Europam terror ubique tenet3

Spes populi procerumque decus Lennoxius heros
Non exspectato funere raptus obit.

Pro Superi! Non haec mors est, sed publica cladem
Confossus patriae per latus ille cadit.
