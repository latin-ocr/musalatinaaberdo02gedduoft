CXLIX. ON THE EARL OF HOLLAND.

ARGUMENT.

Behold with what foolish pursuits the courtier passes life along: one rears
hawks, this other hounds; ,one set pampers horses, another rejoices in the
dance; one colours his cheeks with rouge, another with wine. This one is
wiped clean of cash by a boxer, that by a courtesan and an actor; others there
are whose wealth is wasted by gaming all night long. Higher soars Rich, the
heir of generous racc, because enamoured with Apollo’s lyre. The Muses
whom he cherishes, he also protects with gilded wings, and his joy is to
plead for the Aonian quire. The youth of Parnassus follow him as their
dictator and offer suppliantly due incense to their chief. Ye Muses, give us
back Horace, restore us Maro: Britain has now produced another Maecenas.

CXLIX. DE COMITE HOLLANDIO.

Adspice quam studiis vitam traducat ineptis
Aulicus‚ accipitres hic alit, ille canes, ’
Una saginat equos gaudet pars una choreis,
Iste genas fuco purpurat, ille mero.
Hunc pugil, hunc meretrix emungit et histrio nummis,
Sunt quibus et pernox alea vastat opes.
Altius assurgit generosi sanguinis heres,
Richaeus‚ Clariae captus amore lyrae.
Quas colit, auratis Musas hic protegit alis,
Gaudet et Aonio dicere iura choro. 10
Hunc dictatorem sequitur Parnassia pubes,
Fertque suo supplex debita tura duci.
Reddite Pierides Flaccum, revocate Maronem,
Iam Maecenatem terra Britanna tulit.

8. Richaeus.] The family name of Earl of Warwick and Holland from 1618, when the
title was revived and conferred upon Baton Rich of Leeze. The last Earl of Warwick and
Holland died in 1759 (Engl. Encycl.; Biogr. in Warwick). See also note on No. VIII. 70.
The title Holland is not from the European country, but from a district of that name in Lincoln-
shire (Nichols’ Progr.‚ 4·1005).
