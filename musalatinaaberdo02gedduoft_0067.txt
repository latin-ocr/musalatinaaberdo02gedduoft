ARGUMENT.

I have no gifts to offer, such as Tethys sends from the Red Sea, or as
dark Indus gathers in his green waters. The fountains I draw upon are
those of Phoebus, whence these offerings corne, whatever worth may to them
belong. Accept, and, if time allows, inspect, these trifles. An hour will suffice
for the passing eye. ’Tis the brood of the Eagle that can stand the sun’s
bright blaze. Be it thine to show thy heroic blood, nowise degenerate from
great Maitland in the days of old.
