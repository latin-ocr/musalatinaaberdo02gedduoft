EPIGRAMS. 107

20. FORBES.

Arthur [Forbes]‚ ninth Lord Forbes, succeeded about 1604 and lived till after 1634. The
poet stood in close relationship to this lord, being his first cousin. This Arthur, ninth Lord
Forbes, was nephew to Arthur Johnston’s mother, Christian Forbes, who was daughter of the
seventh Lord Forbes, sister of the eighth, and was wife of George Johnston of Caskieben.

If piety received from heaven its due reward, none would match thee,
thou chief of the Forbes’ line.

20. FORBESIUS.

Si sua donarent pietati praemia Divi,
Forbesidum princeps, par tibi nemo foret.

21. LOVAT.

Simon [Fraser], seventh Lord Lovat‚ born about 1572, died 1633. Sir R. Douglas(Pee1›-
age) quotes this Latin distich in his praise.

The new Fraser born in the far north has shown that out of thorns a
rose can nse.

21. LOVETIUS.

Natus hyperboreos inter Fraserius heros,
E spinis docuit surgere posse rosam.

22. CARNEGY.

The title of Lord Carnegy (regarding whom see jervise, Laud of tlte Lindsays, p. 196,
and Bulloch's Jamcsonc‚ p. 175) was afterwards absorbed in the higher dignity of Earl of
Southesk. David Carnegy was made a peer by the title of Lord Carnegy of Kinnaird in 1016,
and was created Earl of Southesk in 1633. Plura in Nichols’ Progr„ IV. 1095. Andrew

Ramsay (see XCVI.) in laudatory hexameters dedicates his Miscellanctr‚ etc„ not included in
the Delium, to Lord Carnegy in 1633.

There is no counting the wealth nor measuring the rural acres of Car-
negy: yet his lofty mind maintains the even mean.

22. CARNEGIUS.

Nec numero clauduntur opes, nec limite rura
Carnegi, servat mens tamen alta modum.
