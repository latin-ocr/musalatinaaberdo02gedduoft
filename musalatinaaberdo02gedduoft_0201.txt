EPIGRAMS. 113

13. oF ORKNEY.

George Graeme, or Graham, minister at Scoone, afterward Bishop of Dumblane (Row's

H. of Ch.. p. 255 ς Grub, passim), was one of the three bishops who submitted to the Glasgow
Assembly of 1638.

When I look to thy person, Graham, what a poor mortal thou art!
When I look to the lofty pinnacles of thy mind, what a Titan thou appearest!

13. ORCADUM.

Dum corpus tueor, quantillus homuncio, Grami, es?
Ardua dum mentis culmina, quantus Atlas?

CXVI. TO MR. RICHARD MAITLAND.

No one of this name known in the Lauderdale family unless as a servitor of the family.
See entry (anno 1629-30) in Misc. (Sp. CL), V. p. 147. The probability is that it is a Richard
Maitland of Pittrichie in Udny, Aberdeenshire, of whom some account is given in collections
(Sp. Cl.)‚ p. 358; also in Fttuerals, p. 437 ; Nisbet's Hvraldry, Ι. 293. A Richard Maitland,
minister at Aberehirder, is dealt with in 1640 by the Covenanting party (Spalding, Trubles,
I. pp. 311-2). Compare for the vein of thought No. LIII. above.

ARGUMENT.

Golden gifts thou mayst have from others, Mastiand, as thy meed, or
purple vestments with 'I'yrian dyc. I can offer only words with no worth,
accents of no weight and “ numbers '³ whereof the banker makes no account.
Accept‚ as an old friend from another, a trifie in poor return for thy guerdon.
Thy present, Ι remember, was both of corn and wine: I bring thee only
waters from Pierian spring. Exchanging pawkily my poor brass for thy gold,
Ι fulfil the role of Diomed‚ thou of the lavish Glaucus.
