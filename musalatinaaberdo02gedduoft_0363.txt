Another on same by John Johnston in Dr. G. Mackenzie's Lives, ΙΙ. 419.

Venerable erstwhile wert thou, O sacred city, in the whole world’s eyes.
No more holy spot in all the world. Jove, when he saw thy shrines, blushed
for his own chapel on the Tarpeian hill, and the builder of the Ephesian temple,
contemplating thine‚ had smiled at and scorned justly his own performance.
In vestments the ministering priests reflected the splendour of the architectum,
and the whole scene was full of a radiance divine. The primate of the
ecclesiastical order, in gold arrayed, gave laws to the Senators of the Scottish
realm. The old honour is now gone ς the temples have tumbled to ruin‚ and
the brightness of thy ministering priests of old survives no more. Yet thou art
sacred to the Muses and to Phoebus’ ministers, and that honour is not beyond
thy merits. For Aurora, who loves the Muses sends the bearn of her sweet
smile on thee, what time she breathes from her rosy car the soft effluence of
the dawn. Hoarse Thetis too at morn murmurs round thy shrines and bids
the slumbers of thy children to be brief. Close by is the plain where the
youth can refresh themselves after study, and acquire fresh energies thereby.
Phocis was Phoebus’ love of old, Attica of Pallas; in thee has each now fixed

a firm abode.
