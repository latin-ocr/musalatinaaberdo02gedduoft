EXTRACT FROM LETTER OF PROFESSOR MERX OF
HEIDELBERG„

(Expltlinz'ng lzistorical facts as to tlze Titlc of Tliesis given οη p. xxviii.)

DEAR Sm,

Your letter of the 7th September reached me when 1 was on the sea-
side to restore my health‚ consequently 1 could not answer before returning
to Heidelberg.

Here I examined the old Matrikel‚ which has been published . . . under
the title, “ Das Alte Matrikelbuch Der Universitat Heidelberg . .

year 1599. There were inscribed in the book of the University :—
“ 106. M. Gualterus Donaltsonus Abredonensis Scotus‚
“ 107. M. Arthurus Jonstonus Abredonensis Scotus.‘’

Faculty of Theology :—

“ M. Arthurus Jonstonius Scotus‚ 4 October, 1599 ''.

Consequently your man was already Master of Arts in 1599. Ι think

The most complete notice of Theophilus Maderus is to be found in
the Gelehrten Lexicon and in Adelung's Supplement to it. They say that
he died in 1604. He was Rector of the University in 1594, Winkelmann
Urku'ndenbuch, ΙΙ., p. 168. He was Professor of Physics, after having been
Professor of the Organon in the philosophical Faculty. Hantz‚ Gesclziclzte

The Casimirianurn was the re-formed old Dionysianum. The re-forma-
tion took place in 1591, the building occupied the place ofthe present Uni-
versity; it was burnt at the occasion of the French invasion in 1693, and
