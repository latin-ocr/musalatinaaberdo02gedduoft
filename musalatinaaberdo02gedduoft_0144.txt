LXXXIX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF SIR GEORGE OGILVY‚
OF BANFF.

This poem must be dated about 1621, as Sir George Ogilvy is recorded to have died on
1 rth August of that year.¹ This family was raised to the Scotch peerage in 1642, which was,
however, after Johnston's death. A translation in verse occurs in Epitaplzs, p. 146 (Glasgow,

1834). Crawfurd (Pcerage, ed. 1716), quoting this epigram, takes olympiad wrongly as = five
years² and makes his age a hundred and five.

’ ARGUMENT.

Thrice seven olympiads (eighty-four years) lived the knight of Banff,
and his age in years was three times less than his bright progeny did
number. Count up his virtuous deeds‚ and you will find he has left but few
descendants, and, as for his days, they have been relatively few.

¹ Some discrepancy, however, occurs in the records, as may be seen from the note on
Spalding (Trublcs, Ι. 12).

Ter suit illustri posteritate minor. -
