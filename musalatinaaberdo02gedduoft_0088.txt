LVII. ΟΝ HIS NATAL SPOT.

Probably the most graceful, as it is the best known, of Johnston’s poetic effusions. It
embodies the spirit of the Ovidian distich (L. Ep. cx Pont„ 3-35) ;-

“ Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine Musas
Ducit, et immemores non sinit esse sui ” ;

and is worthy by its modesty of a place beside the vaunting but splendid lines of Ovid as to
his Sulmonian birthplace (Arnon, ΙΙΙ. 15).—The district of the Garioch‚ to which Caskieben
belonged, is dominated by the mountain called Benachie, and is traversed by the Ury,
which, as stated under No. XLI„ is the largest affluent of the Don, and receives the Gadie
as a tributary. Cultured life, though among the oves and boves, is here depicted as a true
life in “ Arcady ''.

ARGUMENT.

Lo! here behold, O stranger, the Tempe of the johnstons, rival to the
Thessaliam, outstretched beneath the northern sky. In a thousand meanders
the silver Ury trickles with pellucid waves through the smiling fields. Here
huge Benachie, under sunset at the equin0x‚ casts his latest shade. Pearls
in the stream and gems in the mountain enrich the scene, and Nature displays
all her charms. Birds in the air and fish in the water, cattle in the fields, you
perceive disporting. Crops in the field, fruit-laden trees are there, and a tower
rises commanding the scene-—a lofty tower, yet not equal to its lord’s deserts
—at some three furlongs distance from the companion town. This is my
natal spot, the land of the Johnstons for a hundred generations. Mantua got
fame as Virgil’s cradle : my cradle it is that will give me renown.
