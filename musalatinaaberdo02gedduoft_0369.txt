 

ENCOMIA URBIUM. 273

Ι5. BRECHIN.

Fertile Brechin lies between twin streams-—the South Esk and the
North, spanned by bridges, and crossed by many secure fords besides. Its
fame is from the victory of the Northern King‚ what time the allied chiefs
perfidiously fied. Here is a Prelate’s holy house and a pyramid [Campanile]
close by, the work of a Phidian hand. It is a slender erection, but sky—
compeering. Look at it from a distance, and you think it a needle‚ yet it laughs
at wind, flood and lightning fire. To compare the structure, the town of Brechin

beats thy pyramids, O Nile.

15. BRECHINUM.

Fertile Brechinum geminos interiacet amnes,
Hic Boream spectat, respicit ille Notum.

Rupibus inclusae sternuntur pontibus undae,
Sunt quoque securis flumina plena vadis.

Hanc simul Arctoi decorat victoria regis,
Perfida curn socii terga dedere duces.

Praesulis hic sancti domus est, et pyramis aedi
Proxima, Phidiacae forsitan artis opus.

Si molem spectes, nihil est exilius illa,
Ipsa tamen caeli culmina tangit apex, 10

Est structura teres, nec raro lumina fallit,
Eminus hanc spectans esse putabis acum.

Daedala compages et ventos ridet et imbres,
Nec metuit magni tela trisulca Iovis.

Si fabricam conferre lubet, Brechinia turris
Pyramidas superat, Nile superbe, tuas.

5. Arctoi regis.] The Earl of Huntly might be so styled as victor at the Battle os
Brechin in 1452, when Crawford was worsted by desertion of his most trusted allies

[Collace, etc.].
13. Ventos ridet.] Poetic but not extravagant‚ when compared with the assertion in

the old Statist. Account (1793) that the Brechin ‘⁴ Tower bends like a willow in high winds so
as almost to touch the steeple ”. The distance. between is 34 seet. Jervise's Mcmorials, etc.‚
