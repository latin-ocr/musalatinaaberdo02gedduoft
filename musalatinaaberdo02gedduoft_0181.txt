EPIGRAMS. 93

CXI. ON JAMES FULLERTON AND THOMAS MORAY.

Among the Bacon Letters (11. p. 205, edition, London, 1837) is a charming note addressed
to this Sir James Fullerton, when in charge of the affairs os Prince Charles. He had been sur-
veyor os the lands to Prince Charles when Duke of York. and was groom of the stole to him after
he became king as Charles Ι. Compare the epigram by John Leech (Leochaeus, p. 23), “ Jacobo
Fullastono equiti ab intimis Caroli Principis consiliis ⁷³. Plura in Nichols' Progresscs, I. 461,
and Correspondcncc ⁰f Jamcs VI. (Camd. Soc.)‚ p. xlvii„ on Fullerton‚ groom of the stole to
Charles Ι. (regarding whom see Grosart's Phineas F [εὴ-ἦεν, II. p. 53 epitaph on, in Epitaphs
(Glasgow, 1834)⁷ p. 335).—Thomas Moray1is a poet of the “ Delitiae”. He claimed to be
of the Tullibardine Mmrays, and rose to be Provost of Eton (M⁵Crie's Ltjfc of Mclvillc‚ p. 316).
In 1623 Thomas Murray, who was first tutor, then secretary, to Charles 1., ‘⁴ deyed some dayes
after he was cutt of the stone '⁷ (Sir J. Balfour's Mem„ 11. 97). Interesting glimpse of Murray
in statement of Archbishop Abbot (Nichols' Progresscs, III. 82, also 775), but the most notable
circumstance is that no less a person than Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, when under the cloud
of his misfortunes‚ applied for the succession to Thomas Moray, in these words: ‘⁶ Mr. Thomas
Murray, whom I love very well, is like to die. It were a pretty call for my fortune ⁴* (Bacon‘s
Works, II. p. 251).

ARGUMENT.

Disdaining the court's or king's complainings, Fate has carried away
Moray ere his time. After the removal of that star, Fullerton was drowned
in Lethe’s untimely surge. Let Lachesis tage at will: after such sad deaths‚
nor court nor king can mourn.

¹ Thomas Murray, 1603 (Masson's Drmnmond, p. 250). His daughter was Lady Anne
Halkett, whose autobiography has been published by the Camden Society‚ and gives interesting
glimpses of life among the fugitive Royalists in the Cromwell time at Fyvie Castle in Aberdeen-
shire and elsewhere.
