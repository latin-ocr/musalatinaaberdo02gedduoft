CVI. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SACRED POEM OF ANDREW RAMSAY,
MINISTER OF EDINBURGH.

Andrew Ramsay is one of the poets of the “ Delitiae‚'' and a leading ecclesiastical per-
sonage in Johnston's tirne. Prominent as early as 1617, he conforms to the famous Perth
Articles (Calderwood, 7·256; Meiros Papcrs, ΙΙ. 633), but afterwards opposes the Laudian
movement (Spalding's Trublvs, Ι. 83). He was a professor first at Saumur in France⁷ and
from 1620 to 1627 Professor of Divinity in Edinburgh. In the Glasgow Assembly of 1638 he
presented the report condemning Laud's Liturgy (Gordon’s Scots Affairs‚ ΙΙ. 58), and was
Moderator in the Covenanting Assembly held in Aberdeen in Greyfriars Church in 1640, on
which occasion he was confronted by Dr. John Forbes, the most learned of the “Aberdeen
doctors” (Spalding's Trnblcs, Ι. 447, appendix to Spalding Club edition), and received with
his sons “the town's curtesie'' (Misc. Spald. Club, V. 105). A few years later, in 1649, he
was himself deposed by the advanced party for “malignancy”. As a scion of the Balmain
family, he has interspersed his Pocmata with allusions to Augus and Mearns (plura in Baillie’s
Lettcrs, Ι. 136 and passim; Lauder⁷s Life of Johnston in preface to Musae Sacrae, p. xxxiv.,
where on p. li. is Ramsay's poem in honour of Arthur Johnston‚ a return compliment; Balfour‚
ΙΙΙ. 419; Maidment’s Sc. Pasqnils, p. 49; Gordon's Scots Affczirs, Ι. 10, 17; Row‘s H. of Ch„
and Sir Al. Grant's Story of Univ. of Ed). Interest in Andrew Ramsay would be enhanced if
it could be shown, as has been alleged (see Maidment's Sc. Elegiae Verscs, p. 63), that Milton
drew ideas from Ramsay's “ Poema Sacrum ’' for his Pmadise Lost. It is now, we sear, a
poema sacrum in the Voltairian sense, car personne n’y touche.

ARGUMENT.

He on whom in his natal hour Apollo smiles, wetting his lips in
Castalian dew, is found in our age either drawing incautious youth into
Venus' snares by corrupting verse, or bestowing his leisured hours upon
μ celebration of mad wars, turning Aonia to a pool of blood. Religion lies
neglected‚ or, if it finds a poet, 'tis one whose note grates on scrannel pipe
of straw. Both rocks of offence does Ramsay shun, for he sounds strains
worthy of the Muse, worthy also of the Power Divine. The peaks of
Parnassus here rise conjoined with the rock of Mount Zi0n; Jordan mingles
its waves with Castaly.
