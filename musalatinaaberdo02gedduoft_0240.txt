Ι 52 EPIGRAMMATA.

5. THE PRINCEss MARY’S (z'.e., the future Princess of Orange, born 1631,
and mother of William ΙΙΙ.).

She died at Whitehau, 1660, and a copy of her will is found in the volume of the camden
Society entitled lVillsfrom Doctors' Commons.

To this canvas is entrusted the realm's third hope, scion of monarchs, a
mother’s favourite‚ a father's darling. The face is index to the mind: it
breathes of spikenard and the maternal lilies [of France] joined to the
paternal roses [of England]. Painter‚ pray lay aside your pride: here resign
the hope of praise; this canvas has been painted by the Graces' hand.

5 . MARIAE PRINCIPIS.

Creditur huic tabulae regni spes tertia, proles
Regia, matris amor, deliciumque patris.

Exprimit ingenium vultus, qui spirat amomum,
Et materna patris lilia iuncta rosis.

Pone supercilium, pictor3 spes hic tibi laudis
Demitur3 haec Charitum picta tabella manu est.

CXXIII. ARMORIAL ENSIGNS OF BRITAIN.

A notable cluster of twelve epigrams on the arms of Great Britain in time of Charles Ι.
They will please the herald as much as the classical scholar. In various corners of the Deliticte
there are similar allusions‚ especially to the Scottish lion: e.g., 1. pp. 44, 302, 319, 4253 ΙΙ.

p. 118.

ARGUMENT.

Come tell me, great King, why you join Leopards to the tawny Lion,
and white Lilies to the Muses’ lyre? The Leopards betoken lithe limbs, the
Lion a noble heart, the Lilies candour, and the Lyre harmonious rule.

CXXIII. INSIGNIA BRITANNICA.

Ι.

Dic age, cui· fulvo pardos, Rex magne, leoni
Iungis, ct Aoniae lilia cana lyrae?
Pardi agiles artus, monstrat leo nobile pectus,
Lilia candorem, temperiemque lyra. 4

4. Candorem.] The irony of History smiles at more than one of these flattering
vaticinations.
