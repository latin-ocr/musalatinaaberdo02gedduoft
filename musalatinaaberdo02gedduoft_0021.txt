LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS
IN VOL. 11.

FRONrrsprECE. PORTRAIT 0F ARTHUR JoHNSTON, after Jamesone‚ the ori-
, ginal being in the Picture Gallery of Marischal College, Aberdeen. The
eost of this reproduction has been borne by Surgeon-Colonel Johnston of
Newton Dee, to whom the thanks of the Club and of the Editor are due.
The following extract from Bulloch’s Jamesone refers to this picture :—

The poet is represented as a youthful rnan of perhaps thirty, and has the same
spirituelle expression as the portrait in King's College. He holds in his left hand a
rose, which surmounts his shoulder. His dress is of a brocaded stuff. The picture is
on panel, and is a very fine and but slightly-touched specimen 01 Jamesone's work.

*ff Mr. John Hay, who has had charge of rearranging reeently the pietures in
Marischal College, reports that he has found the date on the picture ‘⁴ 1621, AEtat. 42 '’.
This points to 1579 as about the period of the poet‘s birth, and is a valuable confirma-
tion of the evidence elsewhere adduced making the ordinary birth-date of 1587 impossible.

N.B.—It is proper to add that in Vol. Ι., p. xiii„ the words ‘⁴ AEtatis 36‚’² stated to be
on the King's College picture corresponding, are an erroneous addition appearing in
and inherited from Mr. Bulloch’s otherwise excellent work on Jamssone. No such
words are found in the picture when examined‚ and the photogravure itself at the
commencement of Vol. I. exhibits no such entry. This clears away a most erroneous
statement from the evidence as to the year of the poet's birth.
