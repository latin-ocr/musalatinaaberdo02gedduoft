262 ENCOMIA URBIUM.

6A. ARMs OF THE CITY OF GLASGOW.

A salmon, an oak on which is seated a robin redbreast, a bell, and a gold ring protruding

from the salm0n⁷s mouth.
In remembrance of his Alma Mater, this was an extempore effusion by Robert Μεῑίῐι,1

Doctor of Medicine and Professor in the University of Glasgow.

Salmon of sea, tree of land, bird of air, all promise to the city what these
three elements afford. Forasmuch as the city religiously frequents the Divine
altars, the Bell proclaims that an inheritance exists beyond, imperishable in
the heaven. And to exclude all doubt as to the association of the eternal
with the temporal‚ the Ring, the pledge of conjugal union, is the proof.

Salmo maris, terraeque arbos, avis a'e'ris, urbi
Promittunt quicquid trina elementa ferunt.
