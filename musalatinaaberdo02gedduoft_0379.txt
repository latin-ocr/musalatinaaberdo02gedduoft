ENCOMIA URBIUM. 283
20. INNERURIA.

Urbs dilecta mihi, te mollibus alluit undis,
Urius, antiquum nomen et inde trahis.

Te quoque Dona rigat cristallo purior, illum
Mox Gariochaeis Urius auget aquis.

Cur tua Mygdoniis non surgunt tecta columnis,
Nec radiat titulis Pyramis ulla tuis Ρ

Cur humiles sorbis cinguntur vilibus aedes,
Sacra quibus potius debita laurus erat Ρ

Ante triumphatus te iuxta Brussius hostem
Trivit, et ex illo victor ubique fuit. 10

Nec procul hinc populos Steuarti dextra rebelles
Fregit et Harlaeam sanguine mersit humum.

Te iactare mihi fas est: quae divite gleba
Te beat, est cunis proxima terra meis.

Te prope vitales puer hausi luminis auras,
Te prope, iam canis obsitus, opto mori.

12. Harlaeam.] The great struggle of Harlaw, repelling the clans, took place in 1411,
when Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, was at the head of the Lowland army.

14. Cunis.] This tribute to Inverurie is evidence as to the authorship being Arthur
Johnston's. It is a parallel to No. LV11.‚ similarly on his natal spot.

21. BANFF.
See Dr. Cramond's Annals of Banff(N. Sp. Cl.) on this epigram, Ι. p. 50.

Banff beside the sea, thou art inferior to small Hypaepae, and poor Trica
and Apina were not more large. Yet the county adjoining owns thy queen-
ship‚ and the land of the Boyn obeys thy sway. Nor are corn-crops awant-
ing and smiling pastureS, and barks bearing brave canvas. Temples for
worship likewise adorn thee, also a noble dwelling of the Virgin Goddess of
