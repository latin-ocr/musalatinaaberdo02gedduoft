ON HIS BIRTHPLACE. 21

LVII. DE LOCO SUO NATALI.

Aemula Thessalicis en hic Ionstonia Tempe,
Hospes, hyperboreo fusa sub axe vides.
Mille per ambages nitidis argenteus undis
Hic trepidat laetos Urius inter agros.
Explicat hic seras ingens Bennachius umbras,
Nox ubi libratur lance diesque pari.
Gemmifer est amnis, radiat mons ipse lapillis,
Queis nihil Eous purius orbis habet.
Hic pandit Natura sinum, nativaque surgens
Purpura felicem sub pede ditat humum. 10
Aera per liquidum volucres, in flumine pisceS,
Adspicis in pratis luxuriare pecus.
Hic seges est, hic poma rubent, onerantur aristis
Arva, suas aegre sustinet arbor opes,
Propter aquas arx est, ipsi contermina caelo,
Auctoris menti non tamen aequa sui.
Imperat haec arvis et vectigalibus undis,
Et famula stadiis distat ab urbe tribus.
Haec mihi terra parens: gens has Ionstonia lymphas,
Arvaque per centum missa tuetur avos. 20
Clara Maroneis evasit Mantua cunis,
Me mea natalis nobilitabit humus.

1. Tempe.] Here used for a quiet valley, not a romantic gorge, as the real Tempe is.
5. Bennachius.¹] The mountain is spoken of as a “ gnomon,’' and as casting shadow
over Caskieben, which was close to Keithhall, at sunset in the equinox. Compare the old story,
which is probably in the poet’s mind, as to Mount Athos casting its evening shadow at Lemnos.
—An English version of the above poem may here be referred to. It appeared in the
“Genealogical Aceount of the Johnstons” (Edin.‚ 1832), ancl is, by some one unknown,
a neat English rendering in happy tone. It has been already given in the sketeh of
Johnston⁷s life, Vol. Ι. p. xx.
16. Auctoris.] Compliment to his elder brother John, who had been as a father to
Arthur and the younger orphan brothers (Davidson's Garioch, p. 164).

1 In his prose description of the Garioch (Gareocha, Garviach), Gordon of Straloch speaks
of Benachie as ‘⁶ in septem vertices assurgens, asper et saxeus” (Coll. Spald. Club, p. 22).
Straloch's Latin verses on the district of Mar as the incunabula of Forbes are worth com·

paring (Funerals of Forbes, p. 331).
