C. TOMB OF JOHN COLLISON, PROVOST OF ABERDEEN,

On the Collison family, see No. LIV. John Collison was Provost of Aberdeen in 1594,
in the youth—time of the poet.

ARGUMENT.

August Council of the city, decree a statue for Collison, here where his
ashes rest among his provost sires. Let the right hand be represented
holding the sword, the other the two scales of justice, and be this the
inscription for the world to read : “ A man he was worthy of Saturn's golden
age; A citizen like Lacedaemon's ; Α consul [magistrate] worthy of the city
of ‘ Romulus ’

C. TUMULUS IOANNIS COLISSONII, PRAEFECTI
ABREDONENSIS.

Sancte Colissonio statuam decerne Senatus,
Hic ubi Praefectos conditur inter avos.

Dextra gerat gladium, geminas manus altera lances,
Hic statuae titulus, quem legat orbis, erit:

“ Vir saeclo, Saturne, tuo, Lacedaemone civis,
Romulea Consul dignus hic urbe fuit ”.
