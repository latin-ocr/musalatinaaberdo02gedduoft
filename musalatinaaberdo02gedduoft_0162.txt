CIII. ΟΝ MISS ABERNETHY‚1 WHEN SUFFERING FROM
A SKIN AFFECTION.2

ARGUMENT.

Not long ago a brow of ivory, lips of coral, eheeks of roses and lilies
mingled‚ drew all eyes. Now the fair lady's looks are marred by eruptions
over her young face. ’Twas Venus in jealousy that breathed this, blight.
She, though a goddess, could bear no rival, accounted, as she was, more
fair than either Jove's daughter or Jove’s spouse. 'Tis a cruelty like that
of a Thracian or a Cyclop. If there is no pity in thee as a female, as a
mother, as a goddess, take a lesson in pity from the Latin she—wolf, and
leam to spate young children.

Δ2. ΟΝ THE SAME.

Venus, wishing to rob Miss Abernethy of her beauty, infected with an
eruption brow, breast, lips and cheek. Her eyes remained unaffected, sharp
at once and clear-shining. So the heavens disdain contagion that affects
humanity‚ and the stars keep on their unvarying light.

3. ΟΝ THE SAME.

Why did Cytherea spare your eyes, habena, when she tore with rough
nail your tender cheeks? She thought they were the lost eyes of her favourite
youth, ere he was reft away to breathe celestial air. Either she so believed,
or, Miss Isabella, she keeps them for her leman lover.

CIII. DE ABRENETHAEA VIRGINE, CUM SCABIE
LABORARET.

Frons ebori nuper certabat, labra corallis,
Pingebantque genas lilia mixta rosis.

Nunc Abrenethaeae tetro fluit ulcere vultus,
Et tenera infantis pascitur ora lues.
