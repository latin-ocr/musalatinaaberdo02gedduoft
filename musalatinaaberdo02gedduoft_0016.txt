viii PREFATORY NOTE.

the present volume are much more varied than those of the
preceding, and although rarely so sustained in continuity‚ will be
found to offer much of pertinent interest to local antiquaries and
historians concerning the important period to which the Poet
belonged. In particular, the groups of epigrams on the Scot-
tish nobility and episcopate of the time, and the encomiums
upon the various Scottish towns may be referred to as alone
justifying this re-issue of the Poems of Arthur Johnston.

The Editor cannot conclude without acknowledging his
special obligations, among other friends, to MonS. Brincourt of
Sedan. to the Rev. Mr. Craven of Kirkwall for important
assistance in his investigations; and to Surg.—Col. Johnston
of Newton Dee, who has furnished Appendix V. (the Biblio-
graphy), and whose services and interest in the work of editing
the writings of his namesake and collateral ancestor have been
of the utmost value.
