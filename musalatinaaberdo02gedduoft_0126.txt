LXXXIII. ON ANDREW MELVILLE.

The successor of John Knox in the work of the Scottish Reformation was, during his
exile, a professor from 1611 to 1622 at Sedan, where he died. Plura in LXXXV. His power
and accomplishments as a scholar, here so highly extolled‚ are evidenced by his poems in the
‘⁵ Delitiae '’. In Michel’s Ecossais‚ II. 167 n., it is stated of Arthur Johnston and his brother
William in relation to Sedan: “ Arthur, bien connu des arnis de la poesie Latine, passa une
partie de sa jeunesse a l'universite de Sedan, sur le pied de l’intirnite avec Andrew Melville
qui donnait une attention particuliere aux jeunes gens de son pays venus pour &coutet ses
lecons. . . . William Johnston enseignait successivement les humanites et la philosophie a
l’universite de Sedan.''

ARGUMENT .

Yield the palm, Ο snow-white bird of Sthenelus, to the Caledonian
swan. Thou shunnest, but he seeks‚ communion with the sky; thou
weepest‚ never ceasing: in his weeping there are gleams of jesting. Thy
whiteness is without; his within: one charrn thou hast, but lze bears a
thousand charms.

LXXXIII. DE ANDREA MELVINO.

Cede Caledonio volucris Stheneleia cygno,
Quae reliquas niveo corpore vincis aves.

Tu fugis, ille petit caeli commercia; tu fles
Perpetuo, fletum temperat ille iocis.

Tu foris, ille intus candorem possidet. Unam
Tu Venerem, Veneres mille sed ille vehit.

1. Stheneleia] Cycnus = swan (Ov., Met„ ΙΙ. 367) is the son of Sthenelus—Proles
Stheneleia Cycnus. Cf. Volucrem Stlzenclc'ida = “swan'' (Ov., Ibid., XII. 581). (In Ov.,
Met„ IX. 273, Stheneleius is, rather irregularly, based on Sthenelus; otherwise we should
expect the base to be Sthenele or stheneleus.)

3. Tu sugis] The swan's liking for earth and water, and hating sky and flame
(nec se caeloque Iovique credit), was accounted for by the legend of Phaethon, with which
the story of Cycnus is brought by Ovid into close connection,
