146 EPIGRAMMATA.

6. MEDICINE.

Paeonian arts hath Phoebus bestowed on rne, and the whole growth of
plants on the world’s face is mine. By this resource I eradicate distempers:
with this resource Ι quell poisons, though as fell as Circe's drugs. The art is
useful to the people : your health sustains itself without need of herb, dependent
on no dubious art. 'Tis your tempered way of life that protects you from all
sickness, and against poisons you are fortified by a people's love.

6. MEDICINA.

Carole‚ Paeonias Phoebus mihi tradidit artes,
Quidquid et herbarum crescit in orbe, meum est.
Hac ope morborum fibras evello, venena
Hac ope, Circaeis sint licet aequa, domo.
Utilis ars populo est: tua se nec sustinet ullo 5
Gramine, nec dubia pendet ab arte salus.
Te tua sobrietas morbo defendit ab omni,
Publicus et contra toxica munit amor.

7. ARITHMETIC.

My art can reckon up the countless sands of the sea and the blades of
grass in the green field, thick as the atoms floating in the morning sun, or the
seeds stored up in poppies‚ the celestial fires sparkling in the sky or the drops
shed by Notus from his own rolling axle. In attempting to enumerate your

accomplishments‚ the art of the Abacus begins to complain of the shortness of
Time.

7. ARITHMETICA.

Aequoris innumeras numero comprendit arenas
Ars mea, quotque virens gramina campus habet, 10
Quot volitant atomi, Sol cum se tollit Eous,
Quotque papaveribus condita grana vides.
Et rutilas quot habent caeli laquearia flammas,
Quotque suo guttas spargit ab axe Notus.
Dum numerare tuas molitur, Camle, dotes,
Incipit ars abaci de brevitate queri.
