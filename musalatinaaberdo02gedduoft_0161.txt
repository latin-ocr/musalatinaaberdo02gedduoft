CII. ΟΝ THE DEATH OF ANNE “ QUINJAEA” IN
CHILDBIRTH.

(Subsect of this Poem unknown.)

ARGUMENT.

Here, queen of her sex, “ Quinjaea '⁹ is interred, and, with her, Graces
many. Lachesis shrank from the ill-omened stroke, but the inexorable law
pushed her on, forbidding reversion of the threads of fate. Her piety extorted
this alone, that she might live again, beeoming a parent by her death. So
the Phoenix renews herself in funeral fires. Better reward to piety it would
have been had the long, long life of the Phoenix been enjoyed before.

CII. IN OBITUM ANNAE QUINIAEAE PUERPERAE.

Hie, sexus regina sui, Quiniaea sepulta est ;
Qua tegitur, Veneres mille teguntur humo.
Haec Veneres, mors haec Charites simul abstulit omnes,
Et reliquum terris quod pietatis erat.
Horruit ipsa nefas Lachesis, sed nescia flecti
Lex agit, et retro volvere fila vetat.
Hoc tantum extorsit pietas, Quiniaea renasci
Ut possit moriens funere facta parens.
Sic volucrum regina, animam dum exspirat in ignes,
Se reparat Phoenix, unica semper avis. ro
Plus tamen hoc meruit pietas et candida virtus,
Phoenicis senio debuit ante frui.

1. Regina] Perhaps suggested by a play on the proper name, ‘⁴ Quinjaea ⁷’.
7. Quininea.] Perhaps a disguise for Mac-Kenzie‚ De Quincy, Mac-Quem, or the

like.
