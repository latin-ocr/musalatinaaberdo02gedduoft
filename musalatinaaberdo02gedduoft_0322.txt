CLIV. 2. APOLOGY OF THE LADY’S PUPPY.

ARGUMENT-

Why attack‚ you prating parrot‚ our matchless lady and her dogs so
petulantly? Vv'hy lay down the law to your mistress, and refuse to tolerate
those whom she chooses to prefer to your kith· and kin ? You brag of your
colours in green and vermilion. We too have our varied colours to compare
with yours, and we can likewise show striped and spotted whelps, variegated
like the speckled marble through nature’s prodigality of power. As for dignity
and merits, you are no favourite of any god, while we are patronised by Mars,
and form Diana’s bodyguard. No parrot ever reached the skies : the dogstar
twice over figures in the heavens. Our duty is to guard our master's chambers,
to lie at a lady's snow-white feet, to watch while you, O parr0t‚ are lapped in
sleep, and no price or prayer can bend our faithfulness. 'Tis not our way to
bark, though our Umbrian cousin or the Molossian may; we only give a low
murmuring growl when any young intruder ventures near. We bite for fun
and are seen to shed a tear, and we come tumbling, rumbling over one another
to catch the hem of our mistress’ robe or to play with her playful hand. The
hounds of Sparta and the big mastiffs may give wounds: we refrain. Your
beak and claws, on the other hand, are truculent, and sometimes girls have to
dread your malice. Again, you are a captive, and, but for your cage, would
cease to serve your mistress, who yet feeds you with all dainties‚ cinnamon
and other products of your native soil. Why grudge her ladyship an extra
pet? The gods and goddesses have double favourites ; such as Venus in her
doves and swans; Minerva in her owl and eock, and so with various other
gods. A double pet is no sign of fickleness ; so away with pride, be patient,
and submit to bear an equal.
