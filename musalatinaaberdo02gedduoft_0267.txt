EPIGRAMS. 175

4. DE EIUSDEM REDITU IN URBEM.

Ver violas, aestas segetes, autumnus Iacchi
Munera fert solus, horrida bruma nives.
Tempore cur igitur brumae novus incipit annus?
Frigora quid, luces quid meruere breves? 4
Haec dum, Iane biceps, anni primordia Phoebi
Quaeris in acclivi tramite, mente cares.
Cessit honos hiemi, Gordoni maxime rerum,
Abredonum populis te quia reddit hiems.

2. Solus.] Misprint in Middelburg Ed. (as quantity shows), for solas, belonging to nives.
5. Jane biceps] Janus presided over the mouth of January, the “ primordia anni ’'.

5. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LAMENT OF THE SAME ΟΝ THE DEATH OF BUCKIE.

A chieftain of one of the branches of the house of Gordon. See No. CXL. A fighting
race, one of whom fell against the Forbeses at Tilliangus in 1571 (Misa Sp. Cl.‚ ΙΙ.. p. 38);
another of them was prominent in the affair of Donnibrissel; but this particular Buckie, here
celebrated, is uncertain. It probably refers to a younger Buckie who died in 1630, and would
be os like age with George, Lord Gordon. A facsimile signature of a Gordon of Buckie
appears in Misc. Sp. CL, 1., p. 40.

Buckie succumbed to death—a warrior who while sadly foreboding his
country’s disasters, preferred to die before. The sad end of a devoted retainer
was mourned by Huntly's son; with Aonian waters he bedewed his bier.
Through Homer's song Achilles lives after death, and Aeneas’ fame survives
through Virgil's aid. Buckie excels them both, whose luel< has been to be
celebrated in a great poet's strain and by a great chieftain's praise.

5. DE EIUSDEM ELEGIA IN OBITUM BUCKII.

Buckius occubuit, patriae qui funera maestus
Dum praesagiret, maluit ante mori.

Funera devoti proles Huntlaea clientis
Flevit, et Aoniis busta rigavit aquis.

Carmine Maeonio post mortem vivit Achilles,
Vivit et Aeneae fama Maronis ope.

Buckius hos superat, cui magni carmine vatis,
Contigit et magni principis ore cani.
