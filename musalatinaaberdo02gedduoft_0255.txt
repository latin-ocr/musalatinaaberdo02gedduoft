EP1GRAMs. 167

[End of Epigrammata as publislwd in “Delitiae '' (Ed. 1637).]

*ff Here ends the group of the “Musae Aulicae‚’' as also the series of
poems, as contained in the Delitz'ae (1637), and published in Johnston’s lifetime.
Those now following, to CLI. inclusive, are contained in the Middelburg
edition as a continuation of the Epigrammata, and are, in their collected form,
posthumous publications, only some few of thern, and those chiefly dedications,
having appeared sporadically under the poet's eye, before 1642.

CXXIX. TO MARY ERSKINE, THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
COUNTESS MARISCHAL.

THE DEDICATION OF THE PSALMS.

In this poem Johnston hazarded a comparison with Buchanan’s graceful lines to Queen
Mary, which form the very pearl of dedication poems; but although he could not win in such
a case the prize, he has not lost his due renown. The Countess Marischal‚ thus honoured, was
the spouse of William, sixth Earl Marischal‚ and therefore the daughter-in-law of the founder of
Marischal College. She was a daughter of John, Earl of Mar, the Lord High Treasurer, and
of Mary, daughter of Estne Stewart‚ first Duke of Lennox.

ARGUMENT.

Nymph, sole lady without a peer, from Kings descended, thou shinest by
thine own light more than through thy noble race. Compared with thee one
may deem that Darne Eloquence is mute, that Juno lacks dignity, Venus grows
dun, Minerva is rustic. Through thee the House of Keith enjoys an heir, who
outshines all of his own age, and, though yet a youth, equals his great fore-
fathers. 'Tis not like the Phrygian shepherd's gift the gift 1 offer, though
thyself alone excel without a contest the Goddesses three. Receive the sacred
songs with which the Holy Trinity‚ whose sacred flame glows in thy breast,
inspired of old the shepherds of Solyma. Receive what therein is ours, thou
patroness of the poetic quire, to whom Helicon's own streams are tributary.
My Muse, poor erewhile and ragged and ready to expire, will get dignity and
light and life from thee.
