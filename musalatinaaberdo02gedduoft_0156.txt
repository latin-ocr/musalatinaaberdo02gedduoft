XCVIII. ΟΝ JAMES BAIRD (BARDIUS) AND WALTER
HAY, ADVOCATES.

Probably a poetical tribute intended as payment for some unremunerated services in the
Court of Session. A James Baird, ‘⁴ advocat befoir the lordis of sessioun‚'’ figures in Spalding,

and is procurator for the Mar nation in Aberdeen University at Dr. Guild's election as Prin-
cipal in 1640 (Spalding, Trubles, passim).

ARGUMENT.

Baird and another friend dearer than life, my friend Hay, have sustained
my cause. Both triumphed‚ but, as for reward or fee therefor, Baird frowned,
Hay smiled. O ye Faculty of Law, follow their noble example. Accept the
money of the ignoble throng;.but, as for gold in the physician’s hand, avoid
that, pray, as a pernicious gift of the Greeks. ’Tis a means in the cunning

doctor's craft of disguising the virus of aloe, or crusting over and concealing
bitter colocynth.

XCVIII. DE IACOBO BARDIO, ET GUALTERO HAYO,
CAUSIDICIS.

Bardius, et vita multo mihi carior Hayus,
Me patrocinio sustinuere suo.
Ambo triumpharunt, meritum sed Bardius aurum
Respuit, oblatas risit et Hayus opes.
Gens Themidi devota, manus cui semper aperta est,
Si sapis, exemplum nobile disce sequi.
Accipe res vulgi3 medicus quod porrigit aurum,
Dona velut Danaum perniciosa fuge.
Hoc aloes celat medici sollertia virus,
Hoc incrustari trux colocynthis amat. 10

7. Accipe res vulgi] There is delicate humour here conveyed, and keen perspicacity
is shown as to the two ‘¹ 1³acu1ties”.
