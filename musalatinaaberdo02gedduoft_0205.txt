EPIGRAMS. 117

5. TILEN.

Mulciber fell to earth, not through anger of Heaven or the Thunderer's
violence. Spontaneously he came to bake bricks for my mansion, and dis-
carded Jove’s three-forked levin-bolt. The god lame on each foot has a fellow-
feeling for one lame on both feet, who receives thereby comfort for his gout
and a pledge of affection. Because of its perjury, Troy was suffered to sink
in flame, the blue goddess reserves for him her waters in her cistern.

5. TILENUS.

Non gravis ira Deum, non vis magni ulla Tonantis
Praecipitem e caelo Mulciberem egit humi.

Sponte sua, ut lateres coqueret mihi tecta st1·uenti‚
Venit, et abiecit tela trisulca Iovis.

Scilicet a pedibus capto pede captus utroque, 5
Fomentum hoc podagrae et pignus amoris habet.

Periuram in flammas passa est considere Troiam,
Huic puteo servans caerula mater aquas.

5. Pedibus capto.] Vulcan is the lame god.

6. JOHNsTON.

Not a few grey locks overspread your temples: yet Juno never gave
pledges of offspring to a feeble old man. Who could think that a god came,
deserting heaven and his kind, to build a nest for a bird that is barren? Doris,
in letting Troy burn, reserved her waters for you. When you build in the
Esquiliae of the town, a tremendous flood is needed to cleanse out that den.
