morum Davidz'corum ARTUR1JON5TON1‚'' in which he mentions one published
“ Londini, Anno 1637, 8v0’'. In his Life of J0hnston, prefixed to Nos. 25,
26, 27, and 32, Mr. Benson gives his reason for believing there was such an
edition, but Dr. Irving (page 31 of his Lives of Scotislz Writers, Edin. 1839),
thinks it never existed. ’

36. The Cafalogzcs, in the 4t0 edition (No. 26), referred to in 35, contains an
undoubted misprint. An edition is there mentioned as published ‘⁶ Londim'
Anno 1652, 12mo,'’ but this is corrected in the 8vo edition (No. 27), where
the book is described as printed ‘⁶ Londini Anno 1657, 8vo,” which is No. 16.

37. In the Catalogus variarum. Editionum, at page xvj. of Nos. 26 and
27, an edition of the Psalms is mentioned by Benson as published “ Canta-
brigiae, 12mo ''. Neither Mr. Robert Bowes‚ the compiler of the Cata-
logue of Books printed at, or relating to Cambridge, 1894, nor Mr. Jenkinson,
the Cambridge University Librarian, knows anything of it.

 

38. There is an inaccuracy in the printed catalogue of the Bodleian

Library, 1843 (3 vols. folio), which might lead one to suppose that Johnston's
Paraphrase of Psalm CIV. had been printed in 1620. An entry under his name

in this Catalogue is “ Paraphrasis Poetica‚ Psalmi CIV.‚ 8vo, Lond. 1620 ''.
On the margin of the copy of this catalogue, in use in the Library itself, is a
reference to the press number of each book, and this shows that the book re-
ferred to is Octnplm 1696 (No. 17), the compiler of the catalogue having
apparently copied “ London, 162ο,” from a part—title in that volume.

39. When Wm. Lauder published his Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacroe
(Nos. 21, 22, 23, and 24) the General Assembly of the Church of Scossand, on
his petiti0n‚ recommended that Johnston’s Paraphrase of the Psalms should be
taught in the lower classes of all Grammar Schools. (Scots ilffagazine, Vol.
ΙΙ., p. 534, 1740.) In consequence of this, Mr. John Love published an
anonymous pamphlet of 22 pages, 4to, entitled ‘⁴ A Letter to a Gentleman in
Edinburgh‚ wherein the proposal made to the late General Assembly for
having Dr. Johnston's Paraphrase of the Psalms taught in the Schools as a
proper Sacred Lesson betwixt Castalio's Dialogues and Buchanan is con-
sidered: Buchanan is vindicated and critical remarks upon the Doctor's
Paraphrase are offered. Edinburgh . . . 174o.'' The pamphlet is signed
“PH1L0-BUCH.''. The only copy, Ι know of, is in the Library of the Royal
College of Physicians‚ Edinburgh‚ bound in a volume of Pamphlets [M. 10. 34]
and catalogued under the word ‘⁶ Letter'’.
