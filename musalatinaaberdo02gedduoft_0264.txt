172 EPIGRAMMATA.

CXXXII. TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS EARL GORDON, ELDEST
SON OF THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY.

(From No. CXXXII., onward to No. CLI. inclusive, the poems follow the order as they
appear in the posthumous Middelburg edition of 1642. They are miscellaneous poems, not
appearing in either the Delitiae or the Parcrga or Epigrammata as published in Johnston’s
lifetime.) The group of poems under CXXXII. appears to be in honour of the accomplished
George, second Marquis of Huntly, who succeeded to the marquisate in 1636. His letters to
Straloeh appear in Misc. (Sp. CL), I., 11-16, and seeplura regarding him above in Vol. 1., p. 302,
n. 7 ; also note in Spalding Trublcs, I.‚ p. 32. Allusion is made in Nos. 5 and 9 of this series to
his poetic gifts, no doubt in Latin verse, and cf. 11·8. The most interesting relic ofhis muse is
the Latin distich which had the honour of being inscribed on the palace of the Louvre in Paris,
quoted in Collections (Sp. Cl.), p.3S. A question may, however, arise, whether the “ Earl Gordon '⁹
of the series is not the brave son of the second Marquis‚ also a George, the same who afterwards
fell at Alford, 1645, and No. 3 can be claimed as evidence, for he was wounded in the wars in
Alsace at Speyer. If the poems are later than 1636 (and their non-appearance in Johnston’s
lifetime points in this direction), and if they are of the same period as Nos. CXXIII.-V.,
which undoubtedly concern the sisters of the Lord Gordon who fell at Alford, we must assign
them as in honour, not of the second Marquis‚1 but of his brave son who fought and fell under
Montrose at Alford, but who is not known otherwise to have cultivated verse.

On the Huntly family see notes on No. XLIX.‚ also No. CXIV. 6. A tolerable English
poem on “ George, Earle of Anzie, etc.,'' occurs in Gardyne's Garden.

ARGUMENT.

Lately thou wert leading armies, scion of the House of Huntly, and war-
like Gaul felt the pith of thy might. After vanquishing the foe, thou wearest ι
Venus' chains, and the Cyprian queen draws thee as a thrall. The example of
Kings keeps thee in countenance: bravest Hector and great Achilles were each
a soldier under Cupid. Shouldst thou, mayhap‚ O scion of the Gods, refuse
to follow mortals, there are immortals in the sky for you to follow. Mars,
laying down his casque, kissed the Queen of Beauty‚ and the Sire, throwing
the thunder-bolt away, breathed the confession “ I love ''.

¹ The second Marquis had married Anna Cambella (see No. CXXXVII.) as far back
as 1607, and No. 1 of the series must accordingly be confessed to suit better his gallant son
Lord George, whose death is described by his noble kinsman (Records ofAboyne, pp. 537-8).
