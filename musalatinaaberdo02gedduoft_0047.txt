he called them, though many of them stray out of that term in its strict sense,
one dwells on the delights of his own dear paternal home of Caskieben, on
the banks of the little river Urie or Urius. Here he notices a phenomenonl
which doubtless enlivened many an evening ramble‚ that at the time of
equinox the domain is touched by the shadow of the hill of Benochie-the
same hill that is commemorated in the beautiful Scotch song, “ I wish I were
where Gadie rins, at the back o' Benochie

His reputation is said to have budded at Rome, and his poems touch on
friendships with many Continental celebrities. He did much injury to his
own fame by his most elaborate work, which was the fruit of a preposterous
ambition. George Eglisham, an Englishman,2 wrote a book to show that
Buchanan was an overpraised man, especially as to his version of the Psalms ;
and for the purpose of proving his case he showed how he could do the thing
better by giving a specimen of his own handiwork in the translation of the
104th Psalm. A controversy arose, in which Johnston‚ with others, poured
abundance of contumely on Eglisham’s effort. But while exposing another's
incapacity for such a flight, he discovered his own ; and actually set about—
not merely a specimen, as Eglisham had given—but a complete rival version
to Buchanan’s Psalms. Here, of course, there was no opportunity for
awarding distinctive merits to the two efforts, and pronouncing how far each
was “good of its kind ''. Johnston challenged Buchanan upon every line,
otherwise he had no excuse for offering to the world a different one. Each
was in a manner chained to the other, and the stronger would prevail through-
out. But in the very method in which he set about his work he acknowledged
the presence of a master; for while Buchanan revels with a sort of luxurious
ease in all varieties of measure, as if each came to him in companionship
with the tone and tenor of the special psalm, Johnston nailed himself down
to the hexameter and pentameter couplet. There was an exception—the
119th Psalm—in which he ran over the gamut of Latin metre, as if to show
that he could do so. But he is not without his champions. The Dutch are
said to have preferred him to Buchanan. Hebrew seholars say he is a more
faithful translator, showing great skill in expressing biblical conditions with-
out departing from the course of pure Latinity; and it is easy to see that
his work has a more quiet devotional air than the other, reminding one less
of a heathen classic.

But Johnston's fame was afterwards irretrievably injured in the house of
his friends by an attempt to lift him far above his master. This was the
