EPIGRAMS. 153
2.

England gives the Leopard, Scotland the Lion as armorial bearing.
France gives thee the Lilies, Hibernia the Harp. The Lion with the

Leopards show thee as Mars’ nursling; the Lilies united to the Lyre mark
thee as a votary of peace.

2.

Anglia dat pardos, gens Scotica ferre leonem,
Lilia Celta tibi donat, Ierna chelyn.

Te leo curn pardis ostendunt Martis alumnum,
Pacis amatorem lilia iuncta lyrae.

3.

The Birds that Mars-born Rome bears on shield were ensigns of a rapa-

cious prince and people. A mind agile, mild, poetic, noble, belongs to him
who has for ornament Leopards, Lilies, Lyre and Lion.

3.

Quas gerit in clipeo Mavortia Roma volucres,
Principis et populi signa rapacis erant,

Mens agilis, mitis, Phoebeia, nobilis illi est,
Quem decorant pardi, lilia, plectra, leo.

4.

On your shield and arms, great King‚ you have something to be your
decoration, your delight, your defence. The Lilies decorate, the Lyre delights
thee, while the wild Creatures defend the British sceptre from a foe’s assault.

4.

In clipeo signisque tuis, Rex magne, quod ornet,
Quod te delectet, quod tueatur, habes.
Lilia te decorant, delectant plectra, tuentur

Hostis ab incursu sceptra Britanna ferae.
