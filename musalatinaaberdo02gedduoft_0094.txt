LVIII. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ THREE BLOOD-RED YOKES OF
THE HAYS.l

The armorial bearings [Arger‘zt‚ three escutcheons Gules] of the Hay family are here
alluded to, and the legend connected therewith. Instead of “ iugis ’⁷ we should expect “scutis ''
for escutcheons, but the supportem of the arrnorial device are two rustics with ox-yokes and the
motto is ‘⁴ serva iugum '’ ; whence probably the prominence of ‘⁴ iuga ”.

ARGUMENT.

Once before a Danish foe the Scottish Lion, O‘shame‚ gave way. The
disaster was observed by one who was tilling, close by, his paternal acreS.
Undoing the oxen, he with his two sons snapped up the yokes and, dashing
into the tide of war, with these weapons stemmed the retreat. What shall we
say of the club of Hercules, the harpe of Perseus, the spear of Achilles? The
meed of true glory rests with the Hays and their rustic yokes.

1 Another Latin poem by william Meston on the whole Insignia of the Hays, erest,
supportem, etc., as well as shield, will be found quoted in Scot. Notes and Queries, IV. 4.
