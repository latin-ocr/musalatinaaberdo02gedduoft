EPIGRAMS. 199

CXLIV. TO MR. WILLIAM SPANG, MINISTER TO THE
SCOTS MERCHANTS AT THE PORT OF CAMPVERE.

On the occasion of sending to him some “ Encomia'' on the notable cities of Scossand,
along with several other small poems not then previously printed.

Regarding Spang see Correspondcnce of Earls of Ancram, etc„ ΙΙ. 3683 Spalding
, Τνκὸίεε, ΙΙ. (index), and plum in his cousin Principal Baillie's Letters, etc.; also his

genealogy in Notes and Queries, 2nd Series, 9-349. It was Spang who brought out the tight
little volume of the Middelburg edition of 1642, a marvel of the typographio art in compres-
sion, and containing the collected poems of Arthur Johnston both secular and sacred.

ARGUMENT.

In my gift to you, Spang, you perceive a work neither polished with the
pumicestone nor decorated with Tyrian purple dye. You, however, think it
worthy of enjoying vital air, and the Batavian land follows your wayward
lead. Not Johnston but Scotland owes you thanks: ’tis not my memorials
but my country’s that your taste approves.

CXLIV. AD D. GULIELMUM SPANGIUM, EMPORII SCOTO-
RUM VERIAE ECCLESIASTEN‚ CUM AD EUM ΜΙΤΤΕ-
RET CIVITATUM ALIQUOT SCOTIAE ILLUSTRIUM
ENCOMIA SIMUL CUM COMPLURIBUS ALIIS NUM-
QUAM ANTEHAC EXCUSIS POEMATIIS.

Quod tibi donavi, Spangi, nec pumice rasum,
Nec Tyrio pictum murice cernis opus.

Tu tamen hoc dignum censes vitalibus auris,
Errat et exemplo terra Batava tuo.

Non tibi Ionstonus, sed debet Scotia grates,
Non mea, sed patriae tu monumenta probas.
