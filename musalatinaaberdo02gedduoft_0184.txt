CXIII.1 ΟΝ ΤΗΕ NUPTIALS OF “STASQUIN ’' AND
[ἓξὲξ] HAY.

A Monsieur Stasquin was in Johnston's time factor or treasurer to the University of

Sedan, and in the records of the office of Protestant Archives in 54 Rue Peres Saints‚ Paris,
the editor has seen receipts for salary signed by Andrew Melville, Arthur Johnston and others,

still preserved.
ARGUMENT .

Thou, Phoebus, our sire, at length appearest, whom in a whole year we
scarce have seen, and sheddest thy clear beams. Here where thou first
didst gleam upon the nascent world, here where Caesar has his seat, midway
between both poles, thou now beholdest both, and the world at each apex gets
likewise a glimpse of thy light. All the world receives thy influence, both
land and sea. A mild temperature prevails: the earth is not fettered with
frost nor cracked with burning heat. Daylight and night have equal sway :
life's work has its duly allotted time, and so has pleasant sleep its proper
hours. ’Tis no result of accident; for Lady Hay is linked with “ Stasquin ’‘.

Such a day was bound to bring universal joy.

CXIII. DE NUPTIIS STASQUINI ET HAYAE.

Phoebe pater, toto quem vix conspeximus anno,
Nunc ades, et liquidum fundis ab ore iubar,

Hic ubi nascenti primum splendescere mundo
Coepisti, sedes hic ubi Caesar habet.

Inter utrumque polum medius, nunc cernis utrumque,
Et tua uterque itidem lumina cernit apex,

Omnia Phoebe tibi, tu praesens omnibus, omnis
Conspectu fruitur terra fretumque tuo.

Temperies iarn regna tenet; non frigore tellus
Stringitur, aut sitiens aestus hiulcat agros. 10

Par lucis noctisque mora est; sua cura laborque,
Iit sua iucundus tempora somnus habet.

Non facit hoc casus Stasquino iungitur Haya:
Omnibus hic lactus debuit esse dies.
