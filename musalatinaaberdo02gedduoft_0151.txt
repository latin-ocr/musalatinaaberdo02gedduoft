XCIV. THE TOMB OF MONTGOMERY, A SCOTSMAN,
BISHOP OF MEATH IN IRELAND.

On this prelate see Misc. spottiswoode Club,1. 100; Trevelyan Papcrs (Camd. Soc.)‚
Vol. III. 25, where fifteen os his letters, rather lively, are published. The Irish names of his
bishoprics seem to have puzzled Mrs. Montgomery as strange and barbarian: “The king
hath bestowed on him three Irish bishoprics. The names of them I cannot remember, they
are so strange, except one, which is Derry. Ι pray God it may make us merry ⁷⁷ (Trcvclyan
Papers‚ III. p. 78). In John Leech⁷s “Eclogae” (Leochaeus)‚ the fifth (p. 83) is addressed
“ Georgio Montgomerio, Episcopo Medensi et Clophor ''. ⁷

ARGUMENT.

Here is hidden, of Montgoniery', how poor a part! The remains of such
a prelate, how small the mould that now conceals! In twice two realms the
Montgomeries bear the palm among the nobles and the thousand captains
of arms and gown. This race, [scotia] the land of the sons of Fergus‚ doth
extol, and so doth Ierne, and the several countries watered hythe Thames
or the Garonne. But, far as this heroic family outshines the rest, so far
does he who lies here surpass his own tribesrnen in renown.

XCIV. TUMULUS MONGOMMERI SCOTI‚ EPISCOPI
METHENSIS.

Hic Mongommeri tegitur pars quantula! Tanti
Praesulis exuvias quantula velat humus!

Bis geminis proceres gens Mongornmeria regnis
Praestat, et armorum mille togaeque duces.

Hanc Fergusiadum tellus, hanc iactat Ieme,
Quodque rigat Tamesis, quodque Garumna solum.

Sed quantun] reliquas haec gens heroa, tribules,
Qui iacet hic, tantum vincit honore suos

3. Bis Geminis.] This is explained by the lines five and six, indicating what is
meant by the “four realmS”. He was a scion os the House of Eglinton.
