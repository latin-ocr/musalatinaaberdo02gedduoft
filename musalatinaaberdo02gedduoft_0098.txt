LXI. ON WILLIAM FORBES, DOCTOR OF THEOLOGY.

A tribute to Dr. William Forbes, the famous theologian, fourth Principal of Marischal
College, and afterwards first (Episcopal) Bishop of Edinburgh, who has an honoured niche,
with portrait, in Mr. Lippe’s excellent Wodrow volume. He belonged to the Corsindae
family, collaterally connected with the more famous family of Corse, and early figured as one
of three preachers before the Assembly of 1616, being coupled with Bishop Patrick For-bes
and Archbp. Spottiswood (Booke of U. K., p. 1116). Born 1585, he died in the spring of 1634,
three months after his consecration as bishop (Collections, spald. Club, p. 49. Also in Sir
Thos. Urquhart's Works, p. 269; Misc. spottisw. Club, I. 285; Misc. spald. Club, V.
p. itii. of preface; Dr. Lees’ St. Giles‚ p. 206; Eccles. Records of Aberdeen, Spald. Club,
p. 853 Jas. Bruce's Emincnt Men of Aberdeen, as also Vol. II. of Dr. Grub). Perhaps the
most remarkable tribute to Bishop VVilliarn Forbes is the Latin poem (1634) of about two
hundred hexameters, giving account of his various promotions, by Andrew Stephen, “ School-
master of Fetteresso,’' reprinted in Misc. Spottisw. Club, I. 287. His Latin works, with a
life of the author, appear, with translation, in two volumes, in the library of ‘⁶ Anglo-Catholic
Theology'’ (Oxonii, 1856). A man of peace, he felt the schisms and feuds of the times,
and in his preface quotes Thucydides (ΙΙΙ. 84) as to the fate of peacemakers receiving the
“redding-stroke'’ (τὰ ἐν μέσῳ), and Hesiod (Of. εἰ Di„ 24) as to “zeal” in practical
good. Glimpses of him in Calderwood, 7·542-71‚ and R. Baillie’s Letters, ΙΙΙ., p. 39o.²

ARGUMENT.

Honey for sweetness, stars for light, the thunderbolt for force. The
eloquence of Forbes, if likened to these elements, yet excels each in its
several power.

¹ A kindred tribute may be noted to the same Dr. William Forbes, for which we are
indebted to the late Rev. Dr. John Christie‚ who discovered it in MS. on a copy of Forbes's
“ Considerationes‚’⁷ (Lond., 1658) in the University Library. It appears in Mt. Lippe's Wodsow
volume (p. lxxvii.) in the New Spalding Club series. It is initialled “ D. L.‚‘’ probably David
Leech, whose name occurs among the Regents of King’s College (1627), but the following
emendations are necessary: In the eighth line, as printed, supply satis before ipse ; place full
stop after vetera in line ten, also a comma after loquela in line eleven. Part of the interest
attaching to it is the remarkable evidence of culture which it supplies as to the ease and
success with which Latin verse could then be cultivated in Aberdeen.
