ENCOMIA URBIUM. 265

9. HADDINGTON.

Epigram thereon by John Johnston in Dr. G. Mackenzie’s Lives, 11. 399.

Next to Berwick, Haddington had to bear the brunt of danger, a bulwark
to the Scottish realm, oft defending it and scattering hostile hordes. By pure
force she was sometimes subdued, but in valour never, and she always gave

more wounds than she received. Deem not that only Caledonian chiefs and
warriors here abode ; Scotia’s tutelary Gods dwelt likewise here.

9. HADINGTONA.

Proxima Bervico, caput Hadingtona periclis
Obtulit, et Scotis aggeris instar erat:

Saepe Caledoniam defendit fortibus armis,
Nec semel hostiles est populata greges.

Viribus interdum, nunquam virtute subacta est,
Et eum multa tulit vulnera, plura dedit.

Grampigenas ne crede duces floremque iuventae,
Sed tutelares hic habitasse Deos.
