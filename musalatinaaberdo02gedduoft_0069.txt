ON LADY LAUDERpALE’S EMBROIDERIES. 5

LIIIA. THE COUNTESS OF LAUDERDALE’S
. EMBROIDERIES (1-9).

A series upon the needle-embroidered tapestries of the Lady Isabella Seton, Countess
of Lauderdale. A lament over her in No. CXXXVIII. [On tapestry as a characteristic
ornament of the time, see ΝΟ. ΧΧ., l. 24, and we rnay recall Shakspere's description of
Imogen‘s chamber (Cymb., ΙΙ. 4· 68): “ It was hang'd with tapestry of silk and silver,” etc.]

ARGUMENT.

With various gifts drawn from various elimes, behold the products in
tapestry of the Minerva of Lauderdale. The gold is from Tagus, soft silk
from China, purple hue is of Tyre——but compare the treasures, and the
Scottish needle surpasses all.

2. HER FLOWERS IN NEEDLEWORK.

In early spring, when the beauteous Seton saw the first flowers on the
enamelled mead, she took her needle and traced on linen Flora's footsteps.
There you behold Iris and the Poppy and the tendet Crocus, Violets in blue
and purple and gold; white Lilies with yellow Kingcups, and Tulips like
a sun or stars. The Rose is there, both red and ivory-white-—resembling‚ the
one, her snowy neck, the other her rosy lips; so also the Columbine‚ the
Hyacinth, the Flos Adonis, and eke the Narcissus. Place flowers of Nature
and of the Setonian needle side by side: any eye will avouch that both are
real, or, if painted, painted by the same hand.

3. FRUI'rs.

You behold here fruits in purple and gold, glorified by the fair Seton's
hand. Grapes, olive-berries are there, with apples, lemons and peaches;
cherries and pears and arnber prunes, all the wealth of the gardens of
Alcinous. Zeuxis deceived the birds by his grapes; here are apples, vineS,
olives that would deceive Pomona’s eye, or the eyes of Lyaeus and Minerva.
