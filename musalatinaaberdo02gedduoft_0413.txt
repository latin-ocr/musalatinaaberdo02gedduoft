others the Earl of Aberdeen‚ now President—were first led to
entertain the idea of the New Spalding Club‚ and to co-operate
in its formation. Although he contributed no portion of its
publications, it was generally known that he was employed in
collecting material for a volume on the history of agriculture in
Aberdeenshire, and it is to be hoped his labours may yet bear
some fruit to the Club. ln the meetings of Committee, more
especially—he was a member of two—his large experience
and sound judgment will be first felt and most keenly regretted.

The representatives of the deceased members have, in
several caseS, expressed a wish to join the Club, but in others
the vacancies are still unfilled, and the Secretary will receive
applications for admission.

The Club, at its last meedng, remitted to the Council “ the
question raised by the proprietors and editor of Scotlz'slc Noles
and Qzoerz'es for consideration and report to the next meeting of
the Club''. The Council, having conferred further with Mr.
Bulloch, and fully considered his proposals‚ regret that they
cannot see their way to advise the Club to enter into the sug-
gested arrangement. The Council, at the same time, wish to
express their high appreciation os the merit and value of
Scottz'sh Notes and Querz‘es, and to commend it to the support
of members of the Club.

The Council would acknowledge their continued obligation
to the Society of Advocates for permitting the Annual General
Meeting of the Club to be held in the Society's Hall; and to
the Public Library Committee‚ for granting the use of their
Committee Room for Committee Meetings.
