ΟΝ DOCTORS FORBES AND BARON. 31

LXIV. ΟΝ WILLIAM FORBES AND ROBERT BARON,
ABERDEEN DOCTORS OF DIVINITY.

(On William Forbes, see No. LXI. above ,· and on Robert Baron,
see No. XLI. of Vol. Ι.)

To Forbes as pastor of Christ's flock the world has no peer, nor any to
compare to Baton. In eloquence both are equal‚ with this only difference,

that, while the latter sweetly attraets men’s minds, the former by power
propels.

LXIV. DE GULIELMO FORBESIO ET ROBERTO BARONIO,
THEOLOGIS ABREDONENSIBUS.

Nil, quod Forbesio, Christi dum pascit ovile,
Nil, quod Baronio comparet, orbis habet.

Eloquio sunt ambo pares ; discrimen in uno est3
Quo lubet, hic mentes pellicit, ille rapit.
