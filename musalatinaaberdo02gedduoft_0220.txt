132 EPIGRAMMATA.

7. TILEN.

Poems by water-drinkers, Ennius says, do not long bear the light. But
on whomsoever Bacchus smiles, lze possesses fiery force; the offspring he of
ethereal Jove. If you like the feasts of frogs, go write your strains in company
with frogs below amid the waters.

7. TILENUS.

Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus, Ennius ipse
Lucem ferre diu carmina posse negat.

Lumine quem placido Bacchus videt, igneus illi
Est vigor, aetherei et digna propago Iovis.

Si te ranarum capiunt convivia, deinceps 5
Carmina cum ranis scribe in aqua, et sub aquis.

8. JOHNsTON.

The poetry of Pindar who drank water still lives in the world's eye and
fears no death till the world likewise dies. As for your bibulous friend Ennius
and his poemS, they have perished with their author. No wonder: the bever-
age that carried off the bard, how could it sustain his poems in life?

8. 10NsTONus.

Cernis adhuc pota quae scripsit Pindarus unda,

Nec metuunt, mundo non pereunte, mori.
Quae tuus hie vino madidus dedit Ennius orbi

Carmina, eum domino disperiere suo. 10
Nec miror: laticem, vatem qui sustulit ipsum,

Carminibus vitam quis dare posse putet?

9. TILEN.

Bacchus loves the knolls‚ the knolls are the Muses' most pleasant seat,
Cynthius himself affects the knolls. Hence (under favour of my mystic Logic)
come wines‚ what we call Aonian waters. If you agree with me, let us clasp
right hands, but be each hand charged with a goblet of pure wine. If you

prefer water before grapeS, the cups of Achelous before Bacchus, your head
and hand alike are dazed.
