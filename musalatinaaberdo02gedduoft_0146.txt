XCI. FUNERAL LAMENT FOR FRANCIS HAY, EARL
OF ERROL.

Francis, eighth (according to H. Laing, ninth) Earl of Errol, died at Slains, 16th July,
1631. This is the famous earl who, along with Huntly‚ led the formidable reaction against
Protestantisml about 1594, and was the subject of protracted “dealings'' when under
excommunication by the General Assembly (Book of Univ. Kirk). Sir James Balfour in
his Βίαν] (ΙΙ. 34), referring to the king’s keeping in ward these two earls at a later tirne
(1610), quaintly remarks that the public peace could not be preserved better than ‘⁴ be keeping
these birdes of prey so caidgct upe’‘ (also Calderwood, VII. 158, 2443 Letters of Errol to
James VI.‚ 1596, and King James’s letter to the estates of Zealand; Letters of Time os
James I.‚ Abbotsford Club, p. 16). See account of this “heich and michtie earl” in
Spalding's Trubsts, I. 25-6‚ and in Dr. John Stuart's preface to Blakhass Spald. Club, p. xxiv„
where, also on p. 51, an account of Earl Francis's sons and daughters and their fortunes.
Signature in facsimile, Misc. spald. Club, ΙΙ. plate 7. His daughter Lady Sophia, Viscountess
of Melgum, is also the subject of much praise by Arthur Johnston (see No. LIX.).

ARGUMENT.

Errol, chieftain of the Hays, is gone, the world's regret‚ who was once
its pride. He was enrolled among the Peers through his stem of royal line,
ennobled by the blood-red “yokes'’. Martial virtue and a thousand trophies,
won by his lightning-hand, linked him to the shades of his forefathers. Piety

well proved bequeathed him to heaven. Is there aught beyond this, either
for men to win or for heaven to give?

¹ Edmund Hay, the Jesuit of Douay, a member of Kinnoul or Meggins branch of Hays,

had great influence with the Earl of Errol (Geo. Crawfurd's Clmncellors ⁰s Scothrnd, p. 157).
Seal os this Francis in Laing's Seals, 11. No. 482.
