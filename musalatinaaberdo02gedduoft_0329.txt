CLV. ΟΝ THE DEATH OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
JAMES STEWART, EARL OF MORAY.

ARGUMENT.

While blades are seen sharpening for civil war,¹ Moray escapes to the
stam, and Scotland that gave him a cradle now affords a tomb. His
youth was nursed by Franee and Italy and the land whose insignia are the
Lilies mingled with the Roses. Of noble birth, nobly affianced, he had a
majestic presence and discreet heart‚ with honeyed tongue. Virtue and
piety, a noble hospitality and stainless honour were his; and, though he
learned the craft of war, he preferred the arts of peace. A student of his
country's annals and his own, he yet found time for manly sports, for the
chase and falconry, and could turn and wind his steed in noble horsemanship.
Here rests the mirror of all noble worth such as fiourished in the ancient days,

¹ The second Earl of Moray died in 1638, when the civil war was looming in the
distance. See also CXIV. 13 on this earl.

CLV. IN OBITUM ILLUSTRISSIMI VIRI IACOBI
STEUARTII, COMITIS MORAVIAE.

In patriam patrios acui dum cerneret enses
Dux Moravum, propero scandit in astra gradu.
Occidit ante diem? cunas quae eontulit olim,
Scotia, nunc tumulum praebet et ossa tegit.
Celtica nutricem se iactat et Italis ora,
Quaeque gerit clipeo lilia mixta rosis.
Regius Heroi sanguis, sata regibus uxor
Contigit, et thalamo pignora digna Iovis.
