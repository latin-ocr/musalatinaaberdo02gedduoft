LXXV. TO JAMES JOHNSTON, BARON JOHNSTON.

James Johnston, or, according to the spelling of the Durnfriesshire branch, Johnstone‚
of Annandale, was elevated to the peerage in 1633, by the title of Lord Johnston os Lochwood,

and died in 1653.

ARGUMENT.

Your ancestors‚ J0hnston‚ will ever be extolled by Scotland’s sons.
To them were entrusted the borders betwixt two malms, reward of valour
and stainless honour. How great the hero whom Wallace chose as com-
rade, who won abroad and at horne a thousand trophies! England trusts
to dead walls piled up to keep out the Scottish foe: Scotia needs only the
Johnstons as a living rampart to make her safe.

LXXV. AD IACOBUM IONSTONUM‚ BARONEM DE
IONSTON.

Maiores, Ionstone‚ tuos, dum Martia vivent
Nomina, Fergusidum gens super astra seret.
Credita sunt'illis gemini confinia regni,
, Hoc meruit virtus, et sine labe fides.
Quantus hic est? socium quem legit Vallius unum,
Inter mille duces fulmineasque manus.
Quantus erat, qualisque pater! qui fortibus armis
Mille foris peperit, mille tropaea domi.
Anglia Grampigenas exstructis molibus hostes
Arcuit, et muro iunxit utrumque fretum. 10
Hostibus opposuit Ionstonos Scotia vallum
Invictum, quo nil firmius orbis habet.

5. Vallius.] For sake os mene, presumably, instead of the more usual “Vallas’' =
Wallace.

9. Anglia.] This credits England with the erection os the “Roman wall ‘' betwixt
Newcastle and Carlislc; and there is further srecdom used in the mention of utrumque
fretum, which is more suitable to the northern line of defence, between Firths os Clyde
and Forth, than to that between Tyne and Solway.
