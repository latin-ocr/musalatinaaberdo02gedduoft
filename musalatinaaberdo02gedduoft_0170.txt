CV. ΟΝ THE DEATH OF WILLIAM FORBES OF
CRAIGIEVAR.

On this family os Forbes, see Vol. I. No. XXVII. The william Forbes here spoken of
is second son of umnam, fourth Laird of Corse, and consequently the younger brother of
Bishop Patrick Forbes os Corse (Collectzbns, spald. Club, pp. 599, 601; also Funerals of
Bishop P. Forbes, p. xxxx). He seems to have been fortunate as a merchant (the story in
Abcrdccn Magazinc, ΙΙ. p. 191, seems apocryphal), and acquired various estates, being
designed first of Manny or Menie and afterwards of Craigievar. The elder line through the
bishop did not continue beyond Dr. John Forbes, son of the bishop; and the Craigievar
succession runs, therefore, now through this Williarn Forbes and his children. He died
27th December, 1627, whence the occasion for the poem No. XXVII. His son, who became
the first Sir william (1630, Baronet of Nova Scotia)‚ survived Arthur Johnston (see Bulloch's
Jamcsonc, p. 175). He suffers greatly, inter ιιῖίιι, from “ lymmars ” or Highland caterans‚
and gets them punished (see Spalding, Trublcs, 1. 69, 357).

ARGUMENT.

The tomb of a noble Forbes you now behold: hear now as to his
character and mind. The toil of others to obtain wealth was, while he
lived, to him a pastime. WVhen called on to depart this life, he said with a
smile: “Farewvell, earth; my possession is now in heaven'’. His wealth,
his acres let not any one admire: it was better to be lord of himself apart
from lands.

CV. IN OsslTUM GULIELMI FORBESII CRAGIVARRII.

Nobilis hic tumulum Forbesi conspicis3 audi
Qui fuerint mores, ingeniumque viri.

Quod labor est aliis, vitae dum carperet auras,
Divitias illi quaerere ludus erat.

Cumque iuberetur terris excedere, ridens,
‘⁴ Terra vale, caelo nunc potiemur,” ait.

Quas possedit opes et terrae iugera, nemo
Miretur3 dominum plus fuit esse sui.
