APPENDIX. xxvii

The other error concerns the date of Johnston’s return to Scotland from
the Continent. Benson and Lauder put this down as 1632, and, although
David Irving saw that this must be wrong, for he noticed that Thos. Dempster‚
who died in 1625, “mentions that J0hnston had already returned [to Scot-
land] at the period when he himself [Dempster] wrote‚⁷' the error once
begun has held its place in the Biographies. The evidence to be adduced
points to a much earlier date for Johnston's return.

Ι. DATE OF JOHNSTON’S BIRTH.

In investigating the first point, the birth date, suspicion was first aroused
by studying the print of Arthur Johnst0n⁷s countenance prefixed to the Middel-
burg Edition.1 This print indicated the features of a man well advanced in
years, and certainly far beyond the age assigned to Johnston at his death;
for the inscription round the rim bears the words : ‘⁶ 1639, Aetat. 52,'' making
him fifty—four at the period of his death in 1641, supposing him born in 1587.
That some confusion has got into the dates is shown when we consult the Print
prefixed to Lauder's Musae Sacrae of 1739. There we find under the counten-
ance of an equally aged man, though with countenance turned in the reverse
way from the other: “ Aetat. 52, 1629 ⁷³. This last is not reconcilable with the
statement that he was born in 1587, and would 1111011- back his date of birth
to 1577, making him sixty-four at the time of his death, an age, certainly, with
which the features of the print entirely correspond. There is· error somewhere‚
but the latter inscription is probably the more correct. As yet there emerged
only suspicion of error, but in which of these conflicting entries was as yet
uncertain. The first real ground of doubt emerged incidentally in correspond-
ence with the Rev. Mr. Craven, of Kirkwall, who, inter alia, mentioned to me
that he was the possessor of an interesting Thesis‚ printed at Heidelberg, at

· the delivery of which Arthur Johnston presided as Professor, and bearing the

date of 1601 Ξ This was startling‚ and wonder was expressed whether 1611
was not the real date, but 1601 was found obstinately imperturbable. The
genuineness of the Thesis is beyond dispute‚ and the possessor of it kindly
transmitted it (7th May, 1891) for my inspection. It bore the MS. inscrip-
tion, probably in Johnston’s own hand-—

¹ The Abbe Boulliot's description of this portrait is interesting, and runs as follows : ‘⁸ Il
est represente sous 16 costume de medecin, revetu d'une simarre, laquelle est reconverte d'un
manteau surmonte d'un collet rabattu. Une calotte couvre sa cheveleure peu epaisse ; sa barbe
claire descend jusqu’a la poitrine 3 de la main droite‚ il tient une branche de laurier, symbole
de l'immortalite.''
