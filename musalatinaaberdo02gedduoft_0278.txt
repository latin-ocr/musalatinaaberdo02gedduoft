CXXXV. THE PHOENIX To [LADY] JANE GORDON,
DAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY.

This Jane became Lady Haddington. Records ofAboyne (New Sp. CL), p. 542.

ARGUMENT.

Lately‚ 1 remember, dark brown Indus gave a bird to Anne: that bird,
when it lists, can speak with human voice. To Henrietta was sent, as is said,
a bird from Thracian clime : 'tis a creature that wakes the Orphean lyre. jane,
if a nursling kindred to thyself delights thee, thou art welcome to have me sent
to thee by the painted Arab. Purple is my clothing‚ and a Tyrian dress like thine
is my garment3 my neck is rival to thy ringlets. Part of my tail is blue, part
purple with African dye; the former recalls the colour of thine eyes, the latter
of thy lips. A pink diadem sparkles on my brow, like that wherewith thou,
Goddess, bindest becomingly thy ambrosial tresses. Ten centuries are assigned
me by the Fates : if due reward befalls thy mersts, as many centuries await thee
as well. To me belongs the dominion of the feathered tribes: thou, royal
maiden, bearest the sceptre among girls of high degree. Beneath the eope of
sky there is no equal among birds to me. Earth likewise bears and has borne

no match for thee.
