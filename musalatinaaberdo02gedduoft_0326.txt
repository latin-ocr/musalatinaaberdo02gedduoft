CLIV. 3. GRIMALKIN TO LADY ANNE GORDON.

ARGUMENT.

Enough has been heard from that prating pair; it is meet to hear a few
fit words from me. My claim is not because Ι flatter a mistress, nor tease
and plague my fellows, nor do Ι boast a sleek‚ gay-coloured skin; but hearken
to what heaven has bestowed as my peculias boon. Masculine courage and
fiery ardour are ours : we cats are a martial troop. Besides a fierce countenance,
nature has given us eyes of flame that see in the dark, and alone of quadrupeds
we find our way in the gloom of night. A whiskered face, a tongue that
scrapes like a file, stiff claws, now strained to scratch, and anon drawn in
within velvet paws, compose our panoply. When roused, Ι am taken for a
lion or the lion’s cousin, and my delight is catching prey. Not the mouse
alone, but feathered fowl I hunt after. And so, lady, when you wish a
harmless and not dangerous hunt, you need not elimb dangerous Grampian
heights‚ following, like an Amazon, shaggy hounds; you can enjoy a hunt
at home, watching how I lie in wait for my prey at the chinks and eran'nies
and then pounce on the trembling rover. After a little play, the victim is
presented stretched before your feet. So in bird-hunting; don't take the
falcon to that work, but leave me to the duty, for, though Ι have no wings,

Ι capture the winged prey. If such sports please your ladyship, give me a
place among your favourite pets.

CLIV. 3. AELURUS AD ANNAM GORDONIAM.

Sat canis, Anna, tuas, sat psittacus imbuit aures,
Ambo simul stulta garrulitate pares.

Si vacat, aelurum nec dedignaris alumnum,
Fas mihi sit de me pauca sed apta loqui.

Non ego te palpo, socios nee vellico; feli
Artibus his famam quaerere turpe puto,

Nec proavum titulos, superum nec iacto favorem
Plus satis est domina te, Dea, posse frui.

3. Aelurum.] The Greek αἴλουρος, as well as Latin “ felis‚⁷’ do duty in this poem.
