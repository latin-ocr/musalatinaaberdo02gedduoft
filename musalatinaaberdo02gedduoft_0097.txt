oN “ HYLUS 25

LX. ΟΝ “HYLUS‚’' A POPULAR HARANGUER.

ARGUMENT.

If you want to woo sweet sleep, seek not the silence of the night or the
noise of water gliding by, or song of birds, or tones of the lyre, or the grains
of poppy seed. You need not go to couch or take exercise or woo slumber
through eating dainties or drinking wine. To compass sleep that knows no
interruption, you have only to hear while Hylus harangues.

LX. DE HYLO CONCIONATORE.

Qui dormire paras, nocturna silentia noli
Quaerere, nec strepitum praetereuntis aquae;
Neo voluerum, nec quos edit lyra tinnula cantus,
Quaeque soporiferum grana papaver habet ;

Nec molli te crede toro, nec membra fatiga,
Nec dape, nec sumpto lumina conde mero:

Ut sopor obrepat non expugnabilis, audi,
Dum coram populo rhetoricatur, Hylum.

8. Hylus.] Who ‘⁴ Hylus'’ was is uncertain. James Wood, a leading Presbyterian
about 1649 (see Jaffray‘s Diary, p. 166), would suit as to the name, hardly as to the time.
Note the poet’s feeling for the soporific sounds of Nature, enumerated somewhat as in
Wordsworth⁷s sonnet on the same: “A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by,’' etc.
