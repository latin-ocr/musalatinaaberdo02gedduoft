CXLVII. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SPOUSE OF ENDYMION PORTER, OF
THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ FIRST OF
JANUARY, FROM THE ENGLISH.

Endymion Portet accompanied Prinee Charles and Buckingham in their expedition to
Madrid, 1623 (Nichols' Progr.‚ 4·877, 94o); was mixed up in the fortunes of King Charles I. ;
see also three interesting letters by Porter in N iclzolas Papers (Camd. ὅσα), Vol. 1. The vein

of thought is kindred with that of CXLVII. ‚

ARGUMENT.

Go hunt the Armenian wild beast‚ and send its precious skin as a present
to Endymion's Goddess. Such be the presents to the Goddess, although she
herself is softer and whiter than any Armenian wild beast. Climb mountain
peaks‚ and if in those rocks there is any star, whose rays a diamond concen-
trates in a short blaze, you will lay it at the feet of the Goddess, who sur-
passes with her eyes all the light that Jove's high lightning bolt can yield. Dive
in the eastern waves‚ and there let the pearl be sought, which you see formed by
the dew of heaven. Let‚ Ι say, the pearl be sought though it dazzles the eyes
of Kings‚ and let it surpass all the wealth that the sea conceals. Yield this
also to the Goddess‚ although to her a tear is more precious than gerns, such
as the shell produces. What royal mandates do Ι here enjoin? With what
languid service do my attendants wait on me for my behests ? The Goth does
not hunt for me, neither does the brown-coloured Indian climb rocks nor the
’ sluggish race of Aethiopians enter the waters. Though thus emulous of Kings
whom their own sels-confidence deceives‚ ‘tis in credit rather than in real
assets that our Muse gives boons.
