130 EPIGRAMMATA.

3. TILEN.

No wonder, Paris, that a female [Juno] burst into boiling rage, when
deemed unworthy of the apple-prize. Here is a similar outburst of spleen
from one whom the beard, though he is childless, proclaims a man. This

puzzles me: can you, Johnston, read this riddle, why he should call things .
good to him which are very watery to me?

3. TILENUS.

’ Non miror, tumidas si exarsit femina in iras,
Visa tibi haud pomi munere digna, Pari.
En similem ob causam simili iecur uritur aestu,
Quem barba, haud soboles sat docet esse virum.
Hoc miror: tu caussam aperi, Ionstone, latentem, 5
Cur vocet ἐσθλὰ sibi, quae λίαν ὑνγρὰ mihi.

4. JOHNSTON.

4. IONSTONUS.

Melvino fors melo sapit, quia friget uterque,
Aut nimium huic friget nil, nimiumve calet.
Si λίαν ὑγρὰ tibi sunt munera nostra, palatum
Non sapit. An neseis ἔστιν ἄριστον ὕδωρῗ 10

10. ἄριστον ὕδωρ.] Pindar's famous maxim.

5. TILEN.

If to you water is the best thing, your vintage is not far away: lanes and
fields are drenched with showers unending. Gladly I'll wait Bacchus's own
