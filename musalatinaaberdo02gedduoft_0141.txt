LXXXVII. ΟΧ ΡΑΤΚΙΟΚ BLACKIE'S GARDEN, THE
ROYAL TAILOR.

The sartorial art comes to w'e with the pictorial. even of Nature herself. Much of the
descriptions here of flowers and fruits is found also in the poems under No. LIII.

ARGUMENT.

This is Blackie‘s garden, lying amid mountains and waves, far away
under the extreme axis of the sky. Blue violets one may gather, silver lilies
amid golden roses, pinks and narcissi, fresh aquilegia and hyacinth, paeonies
and poppies, flos Adonis and amaranth, tulips too and iris, myrfles, and
laurels and winter-roses. Fruits likewise bloom, pears and figs and mul-
berries, cherries, quinces and citrons. Here you have Alcinous’ grove,
Adonis’ gardens‚ and all the products of the Hesperides. O foolish Nature,
be not too proud of thyself. Art and the owner's cunning [sartorial] needle
have produced this painted scene.
