ENcomiA URBIUM. 281

19. KINToRE.

The acres of Kintore can challenge Eleusis or Sicily for fertility. Don,
the fairest among Caledonian streams‚ doth water it, and the wave surpasses
the soil in fat treasures. The common foll< here pick up pearls‚ such as neither
Hydaspes nor the rich Red Sea can yield. The ‘⁶ union ” that Cleopatra in
her Egyptian pride dissolved in vinegar, passed hence into the land of Egypt.
A tace-course is here, where every year the Scottish youth prance on their
nimble steeds. They fly, they follow, and the victor gets the prize, surpassing
thine, O Elis, in the Olympic field. 7Twas here I became, Ι rexnember well, a
nursling of the Nine, and learned as a stripling to speak Latin words. Others
may extol in heroic song old Athens : this town must receive the meed of my
feeble verses,

19. KINTORIUM.

Iugera Kintorii si speeteS, uber Eleusis
Fertilis et dici Trinacris ora nequit.
Dona Caledonios inter pulcherrimus amneS,
Hoc rigat, et pingui ditior unda solo est.
Plebs legit hic baccas, quales nec dives Hydaspes„
Dives Erythraei nee parit unda freti.
Unio quem Phario Cleopatrae fastus aceto
Diluit, hinc Lagi missus in arva fuit.
Hic locus hippodromi est, populo spectante, quotannis
Hic alacres pubes Scotica versat equOS. 10

5. Baccas.] Of pearls, as in Hor.‚ Sat„ 11. 3, ²41, aceto Diluit insignem baccam.
7. Unio] The fame of the Ythan for pearls seems here appropriated by the poet for
his native Don. The story of Cleopatra’s pearl is in Pliny, N. H„ IX. p. 353 cf. in Hamlet

V. 2, ‘⁶ And in the cup an union shall he throw ”.
