XCV. DESPAUTER REMODELLED BY DAVID
WEDDERBURN.

Despauterius-—or‚ in Flemish‚ Van Pauteren—was a famous Latin Grammarian of the
Netherlands about 1537. His Grammar was remodelled and condensed by Wedderburn, and

hence the encomium by Johnston. On WVedderburn, Rector of the Grammar School‚ Aber-
deen, see Vol. 1. No. XXIX.

ARGUMENT.

By Wedderburn's skill, big Despauter is now reduced one half and
improved threefold. The half is better than the whole3 more profit comes
to our youth, and earlier appears the loved harvest. A year thus excels an
olympiad, a short month a year, a day a mouth, and an hour excels a day.
Hippocrates, were he looking up again, would, at the sight of these new
devices, reverse his maxim, and now say that “Art is short! ⁷’

XCV. DESPAUTERIUS DAVIDIS VEDERBURNI
REFORMATUS.

Arte Vederburni nunc Despauterius ingens
Se melior triplo est, dimidioque minor.
Dimidium toto plus est, plus inde iuventae
Fenoris, et citius messis amata venit.
Annus olympiadem, mensisque brevissimus annum,
Una' dies mensem vincit, et hora diem.
Haec nova si posset redivivus scripta tueri
HippocrateS, Artem diceret esse brevem.

3. Dimidium.] Hesiod’s famous paradox (Opera ct Di„ l. 40).
8. Hippocrates] His well-known maxim, ⁴⁴ Life is shoit and Art is long”.
