LVI. ΟΝ THE BRACELET OFFERED TO HER SPOUSE
BY MARIE DE LA TOUR.1

(See under preceding, No. LV.)

ARGUMENT.

Gems form one part of your bracelet, the other is a lock of hair3 both in
lustre gleaming. The gems came from Venus’ shell, the same wherein she
was wafted to the Cyprian shore. Their pearly whiteness is rival to the
moon: smooth and round they are, like the globe itself or the milky breast
of Venus. The lock of hair a nymph supplied: beside the waves of the
Mense at Sedan, Love wove with these his toils for the bridegroom. ’Tis
in hue like amber or gold or crocus enamelling Cilician meads. In fineness
it recalls fine linen or the filaments of silk. Neither the silkworm weaving
its eocoon about its own bowels‚ nor the creature that weaves with its foot
its cunning workmzmship, nor the Lemnian blacksmith with all his art, is
more dest and cunning. ‘Tis either a lock sent from Berenices brow, or a
curl of Venus, or a tress of thy beams, O sun.
