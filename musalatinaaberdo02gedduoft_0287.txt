CXXXVIII. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF THE MOST NOBLE AND
HIGH-SPIRITED LADY, ISABELLA SETON, COUNTESS
OF LAUDERDALE.

(See No. LIII. A.)
ARGUMENT.

What do ancestral titles, wealth, or husband's fame avail, or pledges of
love worthy of Jove's consort? Where is the charm of locks like gold, brow
like white privet-flower, eyes rivalling stars, lips emulating roses? Golden
virtue, princely manners, glowing piety, what is the real worth of these ? Para-
gon of all perfection, this daughter of the House of Seton succumbed to death's
dart, which has, alas, wounded us more sorely. ‘Twas her fate to perish once,
but we, smitten by her fate, are doomed to perish often by wounds more than one.

CXXXVIII. IN OBITUM NOBILISS. HEROINAE ISABELLAE
SETONIAE COMITISSAE LADERDELIAE.

Quid proavum tituli, vel opes, vel fama mariti,
Pignora quid prosunt coniuge digna Iovis?
Quid coma par auro, frons quid iuvat aequa ligustris,
Aemula sideribus lumina, labra rosis,
Aurea quid virtus, et digni principe mores²
Fervida vel pietas utilitatis habent ?
Cui nil defuerat, cecidit Setonia leti
Cuspide, quarn nobis plus nocuisse queror.
Occidit illa semel : fato nos illius icti,
Cogimur haud uno vulnere saepe mori. 10

2. Pignora] In post-Augustam Latin, simply as “children ‘'. Among these had been
the Joanna of poem No. XCIX.
