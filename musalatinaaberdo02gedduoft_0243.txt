EPIGRAMS. 155

8.

CharIes, icy Ireland presents you with the Lyre: France bestows Juno’s
roses. Parthia gives Leopards3 Gaetulia Li0ns; India gave the Unicorn
which is among your ensigns. Thus the whole world is seen to be tributary
to you, and the remotest land accepts your sceptre.

8.

Camle, te plectro donat glacialis Ierne,
Iunonis tribuit Celtica terra rosas.
Parthica gens pardOS‚ tellus Gaetula leones,
India, quem monstras, movnocerota dedit.
Sic vectigalis totus tibi cernitur orbis,
Et famula est sceptris ultima terra tuis.

9.

One part of your shield, greatest of Kings, belongs to you : one part must

be claimed as belonging to your spouse. The Gaetulian Lion adumbrates

you : you too, O King, the Leopard represents to α claw ,· the latter is nimble‚

the other wild beast is noble. 'Tis the Lilies that the Queen claims as hers,

and eke the Lyre. By her white purity she reealls the Lilies, by her voice
the Lyre.

9.
Est scuti pars una tui tibi debita, Regum
Maxime, pars merito coniugis una tuae est.
Te leo Gaetulus, te, Rex, imitatur ad unguem
Pardalis: haec agilis, nobilis illa fera est. 10
Lilia iure sibi poscit Regina, lyramque;
Haec candore refert lilia, voce lyram.

9. Ad unguem.] i.e., “ To a nicety”—punning on the double meaning of unguis.

10.

In his native glades the fierce Lion wages unending bloody war with the
savage Unicorn. Here they stand in amity, with fierceness laid aside, and
one and the other are supporters of the British shield. What ought to be
the behaviour of men beneath that Prince‚ who teaches grim beasts to drop

their fray ?
