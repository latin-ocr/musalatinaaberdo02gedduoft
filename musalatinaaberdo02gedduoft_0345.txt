CLXII. DEDICATION TO JOHN LESLIE, BISHOP
OF RAPHOE.

This was prefixed to Johnston’s version of the Seven Consolatory Psalms (viz.‚ 16, 23,
30, 34, 42, 103, 145), appearhrg, like those mentioned in CLXI. above, in London, 1633.

Regarding this Prelate‚ see CXV. 12.

ARGUMENT.

In retiring to Ireland‚ where a new guiding star attracts thee, hasten not
away, Leslie, without some pledge of my regard. The volume Ι now offer is
a present panacea, and a mind broken by missortune may here find relief, while
wounds yielding to no other balm may by its help be healed.

CLXII. AD REVERENDUM VIRUM, IOANNEM
LESLAEUM‚ EPISCOPUM RAPHOTENSEM, DEDICATIO.

Laus sacri, Leslaee, chori, dum tendis Iernen,
Et nova dextrorsum te Cynosura trahit,

Me sine ne properes3 nostri cape pignus amoris;
Quem damus hie praesens est panacea liber.

Hac mens fracta malis, nullis cedentia succis

Hac persanantur vulnera cordis ope.

- VIRTUs Nos ORNAT.
