CI. TO EGLA.
(subject of this Poem unknown.) Β

ARGUMENT.

'Tis not my heart that Venus seorches; if she does scorch hearts, she
has her dwelling‚ Egla, in your eyes. Here are her Cnidian and Paphian
realms, and thence Cupid in twofold form slings a thousand darts‚ a thousand
torches. With eool courage I could smile at the Coan beauty's spear and the
grim Gorgon face wherewith she is armed. A shield can repel the spear,
and one has only to turn his eyes backward, and the Gorgon's stony stare is
powerless. Wo's me 3 neither with shields is the arrow of the eye eluded‚ nor
yet may Ι refuse, Egla, to behold your eyes.

2. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SAME LADY.

One day debars Egla from my embraces, and the stream of nectar,
though near, eludes my thirst. Glide‚ O Sun, along the sky: Aegiceros
[Capricornus] is now brushed by thee; ‘tis time the daylight were short.
Return, O night, such as that night-season when Jove sought Alcmena's arms.
Then I’ll not impose any vows on my head, nor chide the stars’ lazy wheels.
