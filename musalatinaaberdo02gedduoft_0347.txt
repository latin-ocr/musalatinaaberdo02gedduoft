CLXIV. ON DAVID PERSON'S EXCELLENT
EXERCITATIONS.

This fugitive trifle (for the notice of which the editor is indebted to Lieut.-Col. Johnston
of Newton Dee) is found among the dedicatory epigrams (one of which is by William Drum-
mond, and in English) prefixed to the book entitled “Varieties‚ . . . by David Person of
Loghlands in Scotland, Gentleman. London, 1035.'’ The book is an absurd congeries, and
the compliment by Johnston may be ironieal.

ARGUMENT.

A big world is here contained in little bounds, and Jove marvels at the
work of human art. In a frail sphere of glass‚ Greece once bound up the
world; now a small paper-chart holds it with great Jove. The orb of glass is
gone, the orb of paper will endure so long as a student or artist shall survive.

CLXIV. IN PRAECLARA DAVIDIS PERSONI
GYMNASMATA.

Finibus hie aretis ingens constringitur orbis,
Et stupet humanae Iuppiter artis opus.
Hunc olim fragili conclusit Graecia vitro,
Nunc brevis immenso eum Iove charta capit.
Vitreus interiit, durabit charteus, orbis,
Ingenii donec cultor et artis erit.

A. IONsToNUS‚ Medicus Regius.
