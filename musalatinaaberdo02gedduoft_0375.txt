ENCOMLA URBIUM. 279

If all these things with them compared be,
They do deserve no praise no memorie ;

That Martiall-mind which oft appeared hath,
That golden Vertue and unstained F aith
Which lodges in them all these jointly doe
Concur to raise their Name and Fame on high ;
They are a courteous People and a kind,

Men of aspiring Spirits and noble Mind :
Riches which doth the haser sort enslave,
They have thern 3 but they them as servants have.
If Worth have place, of Cities this may be
Entitled Quaen, and claim Sov'rcngnitie.

All other Cities Mortalls bear; but This

Of Demi-gods and Hero's Parent is.

1& OLD ABERDEEN.

A pious Prelate dwells in thee, ancient Csty, and rules thee, while Don
and the deep sea send thee blessings. That stream is spanned by a wondrous
bridge of one arch ; the work, Ι guess, of more than rnen. Such was the huge
mass of the Rhodian colossus, beneath which barks swept with swelling sails.
Close by, the silvery brood of salmon glide into the nets and enter thy snares.
An old and venerable temple is among thy proud ornaments: the hands of
robbers have rifled the rest. Rising with twin towers‚ this temple serves as a
Pharos to those at sea, and shows the safe path to barks over the deep. Not
far from hence rise the towers of Phoebus and Pallas, surmounted by a golden
cross and diadem. These were erected by a pious prelate, a king endowed
them with rich resources, and lavish Rome bestowed the titles. The Trojan
horse did not pour forth as many Grecian foot-soldiers, as that building hath
sent forth of men, to be the lights of the fatherland. Noble city, seek not for
a herald of thy praise outside: thou hast within a people to proclaim thy
worth.
