CXXVII. ON THE ROYAL FLEET.

ARGUMENT-

when each ministers to the King, the isle is shielded by the higher Power.

of Johnston’s day, but is now true only if we limit our view to Europe.

CXXVIII. KNIGHTLY INSIGNIA OF ST. GEORGE.

ARGUMENT-

1.

NVhoever views the insignia of the Northern King, must deem nothing Ι
grander to exist beneath high Jove. The furies of Mars he is sure to contemn‚
for the Knight {St. George} protects his breast with steel‚ and the Dragon by
flame. The Gods minister to him,—who dare deny it? for Cupid adorns his 1
limbs with spoils and reliques of a Goddess. Who but would count him
worthy of world-empire‚ who bears on his shoulder-scarf the stars of heaven? ἱ
