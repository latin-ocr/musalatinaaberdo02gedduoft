JAMES GRANT. 49

LXXVIII. TO THE COUNCIL‚ IN THE CASE OF
JAMES GRANT.

ARGUMENT.

Johnston by his services laid under obligation the Lords of Council,
and through his medical help the sick man, Grant‚ revived. A pleader may
serve a client and charge no fee, nor do bought words help a panel more
than ‘⁴ bunkum ⁷⁷ does. Medicine, paid for, is good, but does harm, if you
decline to pay for it : Thessaliam drugs are not more noxious. Either grant
ye the fees which Johnston earned, or Grant shall swim the Styx before his
time.

LXXVIII. AD SENATUM, DE IACOBO GRANTIO.

Praebuit obsequium Patribus Ioustonus‚ et aeger
Grantius illius vivere coepit ope.

Causidico fas est gratis servire clienti,
Nee magis empta reum, quam data verba, iuvant.

Empta iuvat medicina, nocet, si solvere nolis,
Thessala nee peius toxica virus habent.

Aut date, quae meruit Ionstonus, praemia Patres,
Aut Styga tranabit Grantius ante diem.

4. Data verba] This is a severe hit at the lawyers and their ‘⁴ famished win' ''.

7. Patres] If these are the Lords of Session in Edinburgh, perhaps the “ Grant”
referred to may be the notorious James Grant of Carroun who figures so prominently in
Spalding, and who was more than once “ wardit '’ in the prison of Edinburgh, where Johnston
may have been called in, as a doctor, to prescribe.
