EPIGRAMS. 181

ΙΙ. ΤΟ THE SAME, ΟΝ Α FIRST OF JANUARY.

(See No. 9 above.)

Ifa hero may recline at a plain, humble board, Ι ask you to be my guest
the coming morn. Three Gods received hospitality from Hireus in his log-
sustained tenement, and a poor shepherd was Alcides’ host. Nectar and
Ambrosia are reserved for the table of the Gods3 Helicon, the idol of my wor-

ship, yields me nothing but its water. Disdain not the bowls of the Castalian
band: the Castalian stream was always to thy liking.

11. ΑΙ) EUNDEM CAL. IAN.

Si licet Heroi mensis accumbere vulgi,
Te mihi convivam luce sequente peto.
Dis tribus hospitium trabe fultum praebuit Hireus,
Hospes et Alcidae pastor egenus erat.
Nectar et ambrosiam sibi servat mensa Deorum,
Quem colo, nil Helicon dat mihi praeter aquas.
Pocula Castaliae ne dedignere cohortis,
Grata tibi semper Castalis unda fuit. 8

3. Hireus.] Perhaps Abraham in his tent. More probably for Hyrieus, whose story
is given in Ovid, Fasti, V., 499,

4. Pastor egenus] Molorchus seems to be meant, in the story of the First Labour
of Hercules.
