MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

ARTHUR JOHNSTON‚ Royal Physician or Medicus Regius to James I.l and
Charles 1.‚ the rnost distinguished writer of Latin verse (next to Buchanan)
that Scotland has produced, was through both parents of distinguished ances-
try. He is traditionally said to have been the fifth son of George Johnston of
that ilk 2 and Caskieben, and through his mother, who was a Christian Forbes,
he was connected with the honourable and titled family of Forbes, The
year of his birth is involved in some difficulty, being placed by tradition in
1587, but as to this there are grave doubts ; see Appendix No. Ι.

His father, George Johnston, who was the seventh ³ from Stephen4 the
Clerk‚ the founder of theJohnston house in Aberdeenshire‚ succeeded his grand-
fatherin 1548(his own father having perished at Pinkie in 1547)and died in 1593.
He married Christian Forbes, a daughter ofWilliam, the seventh Lord Forbes,
who had married Elizabeth Keith of Inverugie. The mother of Arthur John-
ston lived to 1622, and she was said to have given her husband six sons and
seven daughters, of whom Arthur and his scholarly brother Williarn were the
youngest sons. (Sir R. Douglas‚ Baronage of Scotland.) The grandfather
of Arthur who died at Pinkie had married a Hay, daughter of the house of
Errol, and it is remarkable that the Hays have, as a family, a specially large

, number of poems by Johnston dedicated to their honour. How the old British
name Arthur got into the Johnston family we may explain through the con-
nection with the house of Forbes, where that name appeared as far back as

¹ Parson Gordon (floruit 1660) describes him as “ mediciner in ordiner to two Kings,
James and Charles, and the most renouned Latine Poet of his nation in our dayes '‘ (Survey
ofAbcln., p. 8, Sp. CL).

² “ That Ilk” came from the estate os Johnston‚ in Leslie parish, said to have been
parted with in 1595.

⁴ On Stephen the Clerk‚ the founder os the House, see Surg.-Col. Johnston's Genc‹1log1'cal
Accwnt, 1894, pp. 186-7. In a deed signed at Kildrummy, Stephanus Clericus is a witness in
the year 1384 (chistrmn Episc. Aberd„ 1.‚ p. 170). An early occurrence of the name Casky-
ben occurs in 1357, when we hear of “Andreas de Garwyauch [i.e.‚ Garioch], dominus de
Caskyben '³ (Antnjusties, 11.‚ 36, Sp. CL).
