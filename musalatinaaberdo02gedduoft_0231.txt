THE MUSES AT COURT.

The age of Pageantry and acted allegories had not passed away, and fancy still labori-
ously trifled at prescriptions of the kind that Sir Thomas More in his youth made sashionable.
See Mirrour of Majestie, p. 73. Probably the supreme point of absurdity—allegory in an
advanced stage of lunacy—was reached at Brussels, in the reception of the Archduke Ernest
in 1594. (Motley’s Netherlands, III. p. 289.)

FINE ARTS KNEELING TO THE KING.

From such pageants as that at Edinburgh in honour of Charles I.'s visit in 1633, described
in Masson's Drummond, pp. 196-8.
1. MUSIC.

ARGUMENT.

Phoebus gave me a voice surpassing the nightingale, even Philomel,
amid her poplar sprays. Amphion's strains are mine, to tame tigers and move
stones. 'Tis the painter's fault that you see here entrusted to the undying
canvas, O king, my lips mute and my lyre. Now, animated by your eyeS,
the image will breathe, and mouth and lyre will render their wonted strain.

1. MUSICA.

Os mihi concessit Phoebus, cui cedit aedon,
Inter populeas et philomela comas.
Plectra dedit, rapidas quae possint sistere tigres,
Aut Amphioniis saxa movere modis.
Crimine pictoris tabulae commissa perenni 5
Muta mihi, Rex, hic ora lyramque vides.
Nunc oculis animata tuis spirabit imago,
Et solitum reddent ora chelysque melos.

Musae Aulicae.] An edition appeared in 1635 of the “ Musae Aulicae,” with English
versions of the poems down to the one entitled “ De classe Regia‚’⁷ but not with English for
the last group “ Insignia Divi Georgii ”. It has on the title-page, ‘⁴ Interprete F. K.’' [Fr.
Kynaston]‚ and the specification of publisher, etc.‚ is the same'as in the case of the London
edition of the “ Canticum '⁷ os Solonion, except that the year is 1635.
