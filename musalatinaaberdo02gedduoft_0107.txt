ON ROBERT YOUNG. 35

LXVIII. ΟΝ ROBERT YOUNG (JUNIUS)‚ CUT OFF
BY DROPSY.

Perhaps one of the six sons of Sir Peter Young‚ joint preceptor (with Buchanan) os
James VI. (see Row‘s H. of Ch„ p. 316, n.; Nichols’ Progr„ III. 6o; Letters of Eminent Men,
Camd. Soc.‚ pp. 143, 172).

ARGUMENT.

In spring, with years still immature, Junius dies, a victim drowned by
dropsy. The fountains of Castalia he had almost drained: 'tis not strange,
if too much water overwhelms him.

LXVIII. DE ROBERTO IUNIO‚ HYDROPE EXSTINCTO.

Vere cadit, nondum deflorescentibus annis,
Iunius: immiti funere mersit hydrops.

Castalidum fontes prope qui siccaverat omnes,
Quid mirum nimiis si iugulatur aquis?

2. Iunius.] Latin sor Young, as in Milton's fourth Latin elegy, Thomas Junius Ξ
“ Thomas Young ”.
