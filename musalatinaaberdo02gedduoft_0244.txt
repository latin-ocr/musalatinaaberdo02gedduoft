Saltibus in patriiS, bellum sine fine cruentum ’
Trux leo cum saevo movnocerote gerit.

Hic stant concordes posita feritate, Britanni
Et simul hic scuti fulcit et alter onus.

Quos decet esse viris illo sub Principe mores,
Qui docet immanes ponere bella feras ?

The Aegis Pallas wears as arms: in triple brass she shows Medusa’s
loeks respiring with dark snakes. The boss which you, Charles, display, unfolds
silver Lilies, golden Lyre, and wild Beasts coming thundering on. The triple
brass must yield to the silver and gold: the Gorgon’s snaky monster is no
match for the wild Beasts' lightning stroke.

Aegida fert Pallas ; spirantes anguibus atris
Phorcidis haec triplici monstrat in aere comas.

Carole, quern gestas, argentea lilia, plectra
Aurea, fulmineas explicat umbo feras.

Aegidis aes triplex argento cedit et auro,
Cedit fulmineis Gorgonis hydra feris.

F ierce the Lion was alway deemed 3 the Leopard was thought dire; the
Lilies fragrant, and Phoebus' Lyre tingling with song. Here the Lion lays
aside his fierceness3 the Leopard drops his savageness and rage; the Lilies
yield no scent, the Lyre no sound. To be like the King, the Lion grows tame,
and the Leopard's disposition you see grows more mild. So when the Queen
unfolds her bosom and opens her lips, the Lilies shrink from shedding odours
and the Lyre is dumb.
