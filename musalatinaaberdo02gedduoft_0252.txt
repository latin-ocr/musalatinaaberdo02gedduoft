Burgundy‚ France and England array their several Knights ir} badges
radiant with Eastern genis. A sheep’s fleece 'the Burgundian bears; the
Frenchman rejoices in a sacred [Priest] Flamen, the proud Englishman in the
Dragon's slaughter. Thus the Burgundian Knight takes a shepherd’s role,
the Frenchman that of a priest, the Englishman of a warrior.

Ornamenta ferunt Phariis radiantia gemmis
Singula BurgundUS‚ Gallus, et Anglus Eques.
Fert ovis exuvias Burgundus, Flamine sacro
Celta, ferox Anglus caede draconis ovat.
Sic Burgundus Eques pastoris munia, partes
Celta sacerdotis, militis Anglus obit. 6

Cupid fiuttering round got sight of the royal insignia, wherein blaze forth
a Knight, lance, shield and Dragon. The elf saw and with gilded shaft he
pierced the breast and transfixed the liver with his mother’s flame. Why was
the fierce Dragon subdued by flame, why did spear and buckler yield to arrows,
a cap-a-pie mailed Knight to an urchin boy? The Dragon was from the Hes-

perides, or else Venus' consort fashioned the armS, or the Knight was Love's
own soldier.

4.
Vidit Amor circum volitans insignia Regis,
In quibus ardet EqueS, lancea, parma, draco.
Vidit, et aurata traiecit arundine pectus
Pusio, materno fixit et igne iecur. ²
Trux draco cur flammis, cur hasta et parma sagittis
Cesserunt, puero cur cataphractus Eques?
Anguis hic Hesperidum, vel coniunx Cypridis auctor
Armorum, vel Eques miles Amoris erat.
