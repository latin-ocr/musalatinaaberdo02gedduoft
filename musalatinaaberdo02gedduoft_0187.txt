3.1 HADDINGTON, KEEPER OF THE PRIVY SEAL.

Sir Thomas Hamilton of Priestfield, now Prestonfield, near Edinburgh; created (1619)
Earl of Melrose‚ a title which he exchanged for that of Earl of Haddington (1627), otherwise
‘⁴ Tam 0' the Cowgate,” was made Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1626, and died in 1637. It
was his son, the second carl, who perished in the sad explosion at Dunglas Castle, in Ber-
wickshire, in 1640 (Chambers’ D. A., ΙΙ. 137). Fine seal of this earl (Laing, 11. 472) with
motto Praesto et Persio, and fine portrait with life in Fraser's Earls of Haddington, Vol. Ι.
Signatures of ‘⁴ Haddington '' and various letters, Fraser’s Mcnteiz‘lz, II. 78, etc. See his desig-
nations when on Royal Commission in Fasti Abcrd„ p. 273. The distich ofJohnston is quoted
by Sir R. Douglas in his Peerage‚ and see Nichols' Progr„ ΙΙΙ. 133; Corresp. of Earls os

Plura in Misc. (Sp. CL), 11. p. lviii., and see No. CXII. above.

To none of British race has Fortune given more favour; no one wears
his fortune with reverence so meek.

3. HADINTONIUS, CUSTOS SIGILLI SECRETI.

Plus nulli fortuna dedit de gente Britanna,
Fortunam nemo tam reverenter habet.

4. LENNox.

[This was a dukedom, but the great officers of state in Scotland had precedence even of
dukes‚ and so are first acknowledged.]

James [Stewart], fourth Duke of Lennox, succecded his father, Esm6, in 1624, who again
had succeeded his brother Ludovick (second duke) only a few months before. James died in
1655 of a broken beart under the missortunes of the Royal House, with which he was closely
allied ; the House of Lennox being collaterally connected with royalty through Matthew‚ Earl
of Lennox, father of Darnley and grandfather of James VI.

¹This comes as No. 4 in the Epigrammata of 1632, and a distich, No. 3, which has dis-
appeared from the Delitiae of 1637, is there assigned to Strathern‚ President os the Council.

“STRATHERNIUS CONean PRAESES.
“ Hae tibi sunt, Grami l dotes3 mens nescia vinci,
Libera frons, pectus nobile, promta manuS.''

“ These are thy giftS, O Grahame‚ a mind invincible, free brow, brave beart, and ready
hand.‘'

Williarn Grahame, seventh Earl of Menteith, Earl (for a time) of Strathern, afterwards
suddenly, in 1633, deprived of the Strathern title, the holding ofwhich was held to be dangerous
to the crown, it being a royal title ; and instead he was created Earl of Airth. He lost also the
presidency ofthe Council. The disappearance of the distich from the Delitiac must be connected
with the disappearance from court that befel this earl. His fall was owing to his having been
alleged to say ‘⁴ he had reddet blood than the king's ”. Full account of william, seventh
Earl os Menteith, Fraser's Menleith, Ι. 331 ; signature of his in full as Airth, ibid.. 11. ¹57-
