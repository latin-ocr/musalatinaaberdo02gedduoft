ΟΝ DR. WILLIAM FORBES. 27

LXI. DE GULIELMO FORBESIO, DOCTORE THEOLOGO.

Omnia mel vincit dulcedine, sidera lucem

Prae reliquiS, robur missile fulmen habet.
Eloquium si quis Forbesi comparet istis,

Mel fatuum, nigra sunt sidera, fulmen hebes.

3. Forbesi.] “ Forbes ’² was, two hundred and fifty years ago, a dissyllable. This Latin
form seems clear proof that the abbreviating process, which has made it, as many now make it,
a monosyllable, and which has given us Burns, with changed spelling, out of Burness, had not
then taken effect. Similarly the evidence increases, the farther back one goes, as witness Forbas,
Forbassius (Collectzbns, Spald. Cluh, 461, 503, 606), Forbeys, Forbace (Antiqs. spald. Club, 372,
405), and Buchanan's Forbosius. This is corroborated by the jocular story of last century
(ez la Swift’s Andromache, etc.) as to the antiquity of the Forbes race, which was claimed on
the authority'of Ovid to be as old as the Trojan War, for did not one say, ‘⁴ Olim Euphorbus
eram '’ ?1 a good proof that a “ Hugh Forbes '’ was there l An anticipation of this jest occurs
in the play of words in Robert Dounie’s Greek epigram (contemporary) on this bishop,
under the epithet εὔφορβος (Ριιηενιιῖε, p. 401). Ariosto’s line (Orl. F„ X. 87) also vouches
for the original unclipt pronunciation, “ Signoreggia Forbesse il forte Armano''.
