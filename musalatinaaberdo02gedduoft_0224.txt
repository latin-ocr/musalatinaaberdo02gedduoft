ARGUMENT.

Astonishrnent took hold of me, goddess, at thy birth, and, under a new
light breaking, mine eyes were enchained by thine. Gems from the East at
first 1 deemed them; soon they seemed stars shot from their skyey spheres.
Erroneous both : gems don't inflame‚ and stars have no piercing light. These
eyeS, darting beams that burn and smite, the imp of Venus says thou hast

stolen from him. Etc.

There follows a series of twelve couplets each from Dunbar and Johnston, bandying wit
as to Cupid’s eyes. They are of the usual type of such literature, light and subtle sallies, with
no flavour of indelicacy, though plenty of absurdity. It has not been thought necessary to

ring the changes in an English version.

CXIX. DE OCULIS ISABELLAE ABRENETHAEAE, ADAMI
ABRENETHAEI FILIAE.

1. IONSTONUS.

Obstupui nuper Dea te nascente, novaque
Luce meos oculos detinuere tui.
ans primum rebar me cernere gemmas,
Mox sunt visa mihi sidera missa polo.
Error utrumque fuit ε non urunt corpora gemmae, 5
Et magis obtusum sidera lumen habent.
Hos oculos, quibus una omnes urisque ferisque,
Te sibi ait Veneris surripuisse puer.
