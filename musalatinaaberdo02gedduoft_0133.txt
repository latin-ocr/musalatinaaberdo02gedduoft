LXXXV. TO HENRI DE LA TOUR‚ DUC DE BOUILLON,
WHEN HE WAS LAMENTING A DAUGHTER'S DEATH.

The magnificent title of this prince brings up the memories of Godfrey of Bouillon,
which is a castle of Bas-Lorraine, in the province of Luxemburg, in the vicinity of Sedan.
Through marriage in 1591 with the heiress of the La Marck family (of Quentin Durward
fame), he became sovereign prince of Sedan. Being a leading Huguenot, brother-in-
law to Maurice the Stadtholder and to the Elector Palatine‚ Frederick IV„ and therefore
uncle-in-law to the ill-starred Elector Frederick V.‚ he gives protection and a position
to the exiled Scottish ecclesiastic, Andrew Melville1 (see LXXXIII.). A glimpse of this
duke is obtained in his letter to the synod of the Huguenots at Tonneins in 1614, dated at
Sedan, and mentioning the quarrel of Du Moulin and Tilenus (Quick's Synodzkon, Ι. pp. 447-8).
Born in 1555, he died in 1623, having felt the first wave of the incorporating policy of France.
In July‚ 1615, “a Jesuite is executed at Sedan for intending to kill the Duke of Bouillon with
a knyfe'’; in 1617 he was with other princes proclaimed “traitor”. See contemporary
glimpses of him in Cecil’s Letters to Carew (Camd. Soc.) and in Sully's Mcmoirs. The great
Turenne was the second son of this Henri, duc de Bouillon, by his later sponse (see p. 17),
Elizabeth of Nassau, daughter of William, the great Prince of Orange. The Duchesse de
Bouillon was thus aunt to the unfortunate Frederick V.‚ Elector Palatine. Turenne was born
at Sedan, 11th September, 1611, and educated under Tilenus, Johnston’s friend, as his tutor.
On Tilenus, see No. CXVII„ A. 1.—-In the fifteenth century, Alexander, Duke of Albany‚
brother of James ΙΙΙ., who wanted to become Alexander IV. by submission to Edward IV.
of England, married Anne de la Tour, daughter of the Count of Auvergne and Boulogne
(sic). (Burton’s Scot Abroad, Ι. p. 69.) Accordingly his son John, Duke of Albany‚ Regent
of Scotland from 1516 to 1524, was by his mother’s side of the same La Tour family. See
notes on Nos. VII. and LV.

¹ “The Duke of Bulloigne sent a letter to Mr. Andr. Melvill, dated at Parise, the 3oth of
Januare, wherein he certified him that he had sent unto his Majestie, to obteane his libertie
’ out of the Towre, that he might come to Sedane '’ (Cafflerwood, H. of K„ VII. 153; plura in
Michel's Ecossazlt, II. 166-7). On the long and close connection between Bouillon and the
Elector Palatine, see Green's Lives of tlze Princesses, V. 180-1. In the next generation, in
1641, came, through Richelieu, the final collapse of the ‘Bouillon family, and the complete
absorption of Sedan into the territory of France. As a town, Sedan now recalls Carlyle’s de-
scription of a typical German town: “ Town consisting, as is common there, ofvarIOus narrow,
winding streetS‚ comparable to spiders’ legs; and of a roomy, central market-plnce, compar-
able to the body of the spider '' (Fried.‚ ΙΙΙ. 493).
