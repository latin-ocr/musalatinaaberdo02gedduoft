2. DRAWING.

Lo two quills: one portrays in light bright touches‚ with motion like
yours, O Eurus, airily sailing along. This came from great Jove‘s snowy
wing, when in swan shape he sought Leda's kisses. The other was dropped
by Jove's pinion, when he became the bird of thunder, enamoured of the
Phrygian boy. Each recalls its nurturing bird. With dashing touches yon
feather will portray your doings‚ with deft light touches, this.

2. GRAPHICA.

Ecce duos calamos; nitida hic elementa figurat,
Hic par remigio est, mobilis Eure, tuo.
Ille olim niveis magni Iovis excidit alis,
Cum peteret Ledae basia, factus olor.
Iuppiter hunc caelo demisit, fulminis ales 5
Cum fieret, pueri captus amore Phrygis.
Quisque suam volucrem referens, illustribus ille,
Exprimet hic promptis, Rex, tua gesta notis.

3. LINGUISTIC.

Beneath this roof I sway the sceptre of the tongues, and teach my country-
men to utter languages other than their own. The Spaniard, the Teuton may
here listen to his native accents, and the Frenchman along with thy imperial
people, O martial Rome. Silvery clear in speech the Spaniard is, forceful the
Teuton‚ while gracefulness belongs to him who drinks the Loire‚ majesty to
him who drinks of Tiber’s stream.¹ In expression they differ, but the burden
is the same: “ Live, O Charles‚ the Father of thy Country''.

3. LINGUARUM MAGISTRA.

Hoc ego sub tecto linguarum plectra guberno,
Et doceo cives non sua verba loqui. 10
Hie Iber, hic patrias audit Germania voces,
Celtaque cum populo, Martia Roma, tuo.
Est Iber argutus, vehemens est Teuto, venustus
Cui Liger, altiloquus, cui rigat ora Tibris.
Accentu differre vides, vox omnibus una
Haec tamen est : Patriae, Carole, vive parens.

1 Cf. “ Qui Tiberim Fabarimque bibunt‚‘' Virg., Acn.‚ VII. 715. The dissyllabic form of
Tiberis in Virgil is always with the first syllable long, but Johnston has turned it into a short.
