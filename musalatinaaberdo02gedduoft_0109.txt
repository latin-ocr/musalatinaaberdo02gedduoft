MISS ABERNETHY. 37

LXX. ΟΝ MISS ABERNETHY.1

In edition of 1632, these two poems appear in series alongside of the three which occur
later (No. CIII. 1-3), but in that of 1637, separately, according to the order of the “ Delitiae,'’
which is here followed.

ARGUMENT.

Abernethy has for daughter either Charis or Venus, or one superior in
charms to either. If you want to paint her eyes, her lips, her neck, try to
paint stam, corals, snOWS.

2. ΟΝ THE SAME LADY.

Apelles, had he seen Miss Abernethy's face, could have improved by
sair touches his portrait of the queen of beauty.

¹ Probably Isabella, regarding whom sce No. CXIX.

LXX. DE ABRENETHAEA.

Nata Abrenethaeo Charis est, vel mater Amorum,
Vel cui iure Charis cedat et ipsa Venus

Si tu oeulos, si labra Deae, si pingere colla
Rite θυρὶς, pingas astra, coralla, nives.

2. DE EADEM.

Ora Abrenethaeae si conspexisset ApelleS‚
Pinxisset melius Cypridis ora suae.

4. Coralla.] So in the edition of 1632. The “Delitiae'' of 1637 has, by mistake,
‘⁴ corolla ’'. ‘⁴ Coralla '' also occurs in LXXIV., CIII.
