ARGUMENT.

Corse, our Prelate‚ hath passed away : his spirit is in heaven ; the earth
beneath thy feet hides his remains. The believer's tomb is sacred, sacred too
is the urn within the tomb, and august the dust within the urn. In life he
had a mind sincere, a thrilling voice, a breast free from gall, chaste ear and
liberal hand. Keen intellect was his, and eloquenee like honey: his judici-
ousness excelled either gift. The order of the clergy and the leaders of the
laity have in him a model of grave wisdom 3 the people‚ of moderation. He
won all hearts by his contempt for honours and his paternal care of the fiock
entrusted to him. Swerving to no partisan side, he stood the arbiter of the
just and fait, the mediator of peace. Piety and peace were born at his birth ;
both flourished in his lifetime, and, when he dies, they also perish.

CLVIII. EPICEDIUM PATRICII FORBESII A CORSE,
EPISCOPI ABERDONENSIS.

Corsius occubuit Praesul; mens incola caeli est,
Corporis exuvias, quam premis, abdit humus.
· Est sacer hic mystae tumulus, venerabilis urna
Quam tegit; augustus, quem capit urna, cinis.
Mens vivo sincera fuit, vox enthea, pectus
Felle vacanS, auris casta, benigna manus.
Ingenii vis acris erat; facundia mellis
Aemula: iudicii vicit utramque nitor.
Ordo sacer populique duces gravitatis in illo
Exemplar, reliqui sobrietatis habent. 10
Omnibus acceptum fecit contemptus honorum,
Et sibi commissi cura paterna gregis.
Nullius in partes secedens; iuris et aequi
Arbiter; et pacis saepe sequester erat.
Nata simul pietas et pax fuit; utraque virtus
Floruit hoc vivo; nunc pereunte perit.
