74 EPIGRAMMATA.

XCVII.l ΟΝ THE DIATRIBE OF ROBERT BARON, DOCTOR
OF DIVINITY, AGAINST TRUMBUL [TURNBULL].

On Dr. Baton, see Vol. Ι. No. XLI. The reference is to his controversial work against
a Jesuit‚ Geo. Turnbull, entitled “Ad Geo. Turnebulli Tetragonismum Apodixis Catholica’'
(Aberdeen, 1631). See notes to Gordon's Scots Affairs (Spald. Club)‚ ΙΙΙ. p. 236.

ARGUMENT.

Baton was ere now renowned for fervour, honesty, rich stores of elo-
quence. To these add now renown of the deft pen, wherewith he stirs the
dust of the sacred arena, renown too, now, of polished aehievement. Golden
lucidity is his, a lightning stroke, and acumen such as Minerva might envy.
Lucid he is with no pretence, powerful without pride, acute with no tinge of
viper's venom.

2. ΟΝ THE SAME.

Lo, Baron and ‘Turnbull wage a holy war, each of them born beneath
the polar sky! Both are priests, equal in gifts of learning; equal‚ too, in
the dest pen's dexterity. Here is the difference: with huge effort, the latter
pleads the Italian prelate's cause; the former, God's.

3. oN THE SAME.

(Drawn from the Raban Edition of 1631 of Baron’s Apodz'xis
catholica, p. 29.)

Turnbull, thou triest to prop up the beast of the Tarpeian Rock. The
race of Turnbull got fame of old from slaying a Caledoniam bull. 'Tis the

Roman she-wolf that thy present foe transfixes by transfixing thee.

¹ In a pencil note in his copy of the Middelburg or collected edition, now in University
Library, Dr. James Melvin refers to three epigrams on this subject, and says: “ Deest unum
ex tribus illis epigrammatibus de Diatriba Baronii ''. This has now been found. It had been
dropped from the “ Delitiae’‘ by Johnston himself, probably from its bold vehemente. In the
same connection Dr. Melvin refers to another epigram, of which however there is as yet no
trace, as likewise awanting in the Middelburg edition, viz. : “Epigramma in Chauceri Troilum
a Francisco Kinaston, equite aurato, Latine redditum ''.
