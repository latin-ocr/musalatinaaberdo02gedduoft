ΤΗΕ CHRONOLOGY OF JOHNSTON’S LIFE.

ΤΗΕ current Biography of Arthur Johnston‚ which has formed the basis of
the traditional accounts regarding him, is that which appeared in 1741, pre-
fixed to Benson’s Edition of his Version of the Psalms. It was eomposed
originally in English, and was translated into Latin, of which an English
re-translation is found at the commencement of the previous volume of
the Musa Latina Aberdoneusis. Priority as to time is due to another Bio-
graphy, which appeared in 1739, the Life, viz„ which is found prefixed to
William Lauder’s Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacrae, a work which issued
from Edinburgh, and bears the publishers⁷ names of Thomas and Walter
Ruddiman.

On these two Biographies have been based the Lives that have subse-
quently become current, such as those in Chambers' Lives of Enzinent Scots-
men, in Bruce's Eminent Men ofAberdeen, and in David Irving's Lives of
Scotish Writers, as well as the more recent one by Rev. Al. Gordon (of
Manchester)‚ in the National Biograplzy. By far the weightiest and best is
the very careful Biography by a non-Eritish author, the Abbe Boulliot‚ in
his work called Biographie Ανᾱειιηιιῖςε, Paris, 1830, to which we have 'fre-
quent occasion to allude. Even the most critical and painstaking of the
British Biographies‚ such as the two last named, labour under a grievous
inaccuraey which has been propagated from the primary Biographies in a way
to vitiate the chronology of the earlier part ofJohnston's career.

There are two chronological errors which require correction in these
Biographies. First, as to the date of Johnston's birth, which was assumed
by Laudes and Benson as 1587, and has come to be repeated in all subse-
quent biographies The evidence now adducible is conclusive that this date
is certainly wrong, and that the real date is nearer to 1577.¹

¹The crux is as severe as in the case of Columbus, whose birth date tanges over an
uncertain period of ten years (Pi-escon, Ferd. and IsabclIa, Chap. ν.)-
