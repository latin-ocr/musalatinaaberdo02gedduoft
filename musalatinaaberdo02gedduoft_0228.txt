CXX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF JOANNA JOHNSTON.

Who this Joanna was is unknown. The little poem is a gem even among Johnston’S.
On Wedderburn see No. XXIX. of Vol. I.

Ι. JOHNSTON.

ARGUMENT.

Sudden death hath linked the tomb to the bridal couch, the funereal torch
to the marriage flambeau. A maiden she was when winter began; a spouse
when at its height, and soon, when it had passed away, she was only ashes

cold. Fortune's wheel is fickle, pleasure is ever fleeting, man’s hope is alway
slippery and his life a span.

CXX. IN OBITUM IOHANNAE IONSTONAE.

Ι. IONSTONUS.

Ionstonae thalamo tumulum, taedisque maritis
F unereas iunxit mors properata faces.

Virgo fuit, cum eoepit hiems, cum constitit, uxor,
Mox gelidus, bruma deficiente, einis.

Est rota Fortunae volucris, fugitiva voluptas, 5
Spes hominum semper lubrica, vita brevis.

2. WEDDERBURN.

Thalia gives Johnston the gift of undying song. Where then is there
room for death and funereal torches ?

2. WEDDERBURNUS.

Ionstono carmen dedit immortale Thalia,
Quis morti hie facibus funereisque locus?
