LXXIX. ΟΝ BISHOP EUDOXUS’S DOVECOT.

ARGUMENT.

The bishop's doves, reared in a tower adjoining the eathedral, have
forsaken the old haunts. The expelling cause was not the screech-owl or
a troop of nasty weasels, nor the sea-mar, nor the church bells' tinkle‚ nor
the rush of water gurgling by. No bird of J0ve nor any hawk was dreaded.
’Tis the face of the austere bishop whereat the birds of Venus are afraid.

LXXIX. DE COLUMBARIO EUDOXI PRAESULIS.

Quas aluit templo turris vicina, columbae
Praesulis ani-iquos deseruere lares,
Non strigis has solitis exegit pupula mdis,
Nee mustelarum perniciosa cohors:
Nec pelagi murmur, nec tintinnabula templi
Proxima, nec strepitus praetereuntis aquae;
Nec circumvolitans magni Iovis armiger ales
Linquere Chaonias tecta coegit aves3
Rostra nee accipitris metuerunt z sola volucres
Cypridis austeri praesulis ora timent. 10

Eudoxus] Conjectures as to this pseudonym under LXXIII. It is odd to find
in Spalding's history of the Trubles (ΙΙ. 98) that the “dowcat” or dovecot of the Episcopal
Bishops of Aberdeen (the last of whom, in Charles I.’s time, was Eellenden) was the earliest
part of the palace episcopal to suffer demolition.
