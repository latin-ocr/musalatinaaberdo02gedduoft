XXX APPENDIX.

II. DATE OF RETURN TO SCOTLAND.

The second error in most previous biographies has been the assumption
that Johnston returned to Scotland only in 1632 (in Scotiam, anno 1632,
redux—Lauda), and so Bruee, who makes him leave Scotland in 1608 ! We
now know that he was back in Aberdeen at least ten years before that date,
viz„ in 1622.1 In the Town Baptismal Register he has a child baptised 1oth
April, 1622. On 12th April, 1622, he is present at a deposition by john Roche‚
minister of Nigg, as to a case of manslaughter, and signs as “ Witness ” and
D.M.‚ i.e., Doctor of Medicine (Register of Privy Council‚ X11.‚ p. 780). On
5th August, 1622, he becomes Burgess and Guild-Brother of Aberdeen (Burglz
Records, p. 377, Sp. CL). This connection harmonises with the statement in

endeavoured to suit it to the English, as nearly as the idiom of the two languages would well
permit. And is some of the expressions should seem too distant for an English reader (which
another person may, perhaps, be better able to judge of than myseli), Ι think it might be
easier to bend that language a little to the Latin, than the contrary.

I have not put, what is said of Erythraeus, so strong, as it is in the English3 since upon
the revival of learning there were several good Latin poets in Italy before his time, and there-
fore Ι do not so well perceive‚ how he can be said to have in a manner raised that Art out of
its grave. And perhaps it might not be amiss to cite some authority (near that time) in the
margin, for what is said of his observations.

Alluding to your account, the degree of doctor of physic wa's confered on A. J. at Padua.
June the 3, 1610. So that if he was born before that month in the year 1587, he must have
entered upon his twenty-fourth year, before he received that honour. And after he left Padua,
he traveled thro' several countries, before he settled in France. And yet, according to the
account of Sr. Thomas Urquhart‚ ‘⁵ before he was full three and twenty years of age he was
laureated poet at Paris ''. Ι am therefore at a loss how to reconcile these two periods. For
isit be supposed, that he was born after the 3 of June, 1587, yet the remainder of that year
seems too short for him to have visited those several countries, after he went from Padua, and
then to have acquired the laurel at Paris3 as he must have done, to render the two accounts
consistent.

I am sorry, it was not in my power to finish this sooner, on the account of some neces-
sary affairs, which call for my whole time. But is it be now done to your satisfaction‚ it will
afford a particular pleasure to

Sir,
Your, etc.,

¹ Sir C. F. Shand, in Bishop Pat. Forbes' Funerals (Spottisw. Club) (p. 19), seems to
have been the first to point out the error as to the date of Johnston's return, which he was
enabled to do from information given him by Alexander J0hnston‚ author of the Gmealogae'cal
Account of the Johuston Family, 1832.
