XXIV MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

according to the common accounts, when on a visit'to Oxford, where he had
a daughter married to a clergyman of the English Church‚ he fell ill and died.
The Suspiria, of his friend David VVedderburn (printed in Aberdeen in the
same year, 1641) bewail his death, and the Middelburg edition of his collected
works by William Spang, in 1642‚1 may be said to be the funeral monument
immediately Subsequent to his decease. ’

Into the great controversy as to the relative merits of Johnston and
Buchanan which extended into last century, when the Baton of Bradwardine
is represented as taking Johnston's Latin Psalms by way of Sunday reading,
we cannot at present enter. Any discussion of the question will come
more appropriately in connection with the poemata Sacra of Johnston, if we
should be fortunate enough to include them in some future volume. Nor
need we enter on the subject of Auditor Benson‚2 who conceived a strong
admiration for Johnston, and for his pains brought on himself the animad-
versions of Ruddiman and the acrimony of Pope, who gave him and his
proti‘gi‘ Johnston a place in the pillory of the Dzmciad (IV.‚ l. 110). '¹ We
refer the reader who wishes to pursue the subject to Irving's Scottish
I‘Vl‘iters (Vol. II., 33-9).

The above is all of solid fact that the most diligent search has afforded
relating to the biography of Arthur Johnston, He stands out conspicuous
in the illustrious roll of learned Scottish Physicians, Fracastorii under a
northern sky, numbering Pitcairn in the eighteenth century, and Dr. Francis
Adams of Banchory in the nineteenth—zi trio of Classical scholars possessed
of the “ Phoebeae artes Geminae‚'' to use Andrew Melville's phrase in the
Delitiae (IL, p. 123), such as it is doubtful if any other single European

country can parallel. His greatest merit is to have composed a version of

the Psalms capable of standing comparison with that of his countryman
Buchanan,3 and the two stand forth as Dioscuri in that field, having as twin
stars added unique lustre to their native land. Both of them lived at a
period when Latin was the vehicle of cosmopolitan men of letters, and before

¹ This little volume claims high authority, and states what seems hardly reliable, that the
poems were carefully revised by the author ‘⁴ omnia haec diligenter ab auctore revisa” (p. 3).
See, e.g., notes on IL, pp. 212 and 215.

2 “ Bold Benson,⁷'regarding whom Geo. Giltillan has this note: ‘⁴ This man endeavoured
to raise himself to same by erecting monuments, striking coins, setting up heads . . . of Milton ;
and afterwards by as great a passion for Arthur Johnston, a Seotch physician’s version of the
Psalms, ofwhich he [Benson] printed many fine editions

³ There is a curious parallel in origin between the houses os Buchanan and Johnston,
and a resulting coincidence os relation in which they severally stood to the Earffloms, in
the one case os Lennox, in the other of Mar. See Ρ. H. Brown's Life os Buchanan, p. 6.
