CXXXIII. PUPS PRESENTED TO [LADY] ANNE GORDON‚
DAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY.

Became Lady Perth. Records of Aboyne (New Sp. CL), p. 542.

ARGUMENT.

Accept, royal maid, a wee dog and wee bitch, sent from the heights of
Benachie, a present from Eliza. The female rejoices in a queen‘s name, the
male in a king’s; each is the pink of its sex. They are sleeker than violets
and whiter than privet flowers. Their backs shine variegated with Paphian
roses. They were whelped by a bitch that inhabits the eitadels of the sky,
now the glory-of the stars, formerly companion of a virgin. Right happy is
the dam, when bidding farewell to earth she has won her way to climb Jove’s
gleaming shrine. The tiny offspring surpasses the fortune of their dam, in
that they enter the gilded home where you, Anne, reside. A noble pair, they
will romp with you in the shining hall, and from your feeding hand they will
nibble ambrosial tit-bits. As often as they give little growls, pretending to be
angry, 'twill be yours to stroke their silken backs with snowy hand. Perhaps
they will dare to give kisses to rosy lips, or, if they are not so bold, you, divine
creature, will perhaps bestow them. Peradventure too they will, as brother
and sister, invade your lap, and will, each of thern, in your soft bosom dare to
snore. Why did Jove lay aside his power divine and assume a swan’s plumage
· and the twisted horns of a scowling bull? Should any of the celestials be
amorous‚ let him take the shape of Eliza's gifts, if he aspires, O Anna, to a
nearer fruition of your lips.
