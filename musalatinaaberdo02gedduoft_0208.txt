120 EPIGRAMMATA.

10. JoHNsToN.

Forgive the bard : ere long the offending paper will pay the penalty, for
presuming to murmur against the mighty powers. The fires which it insulted
will turn it into ashes, and the ashes will experience avenging waters. If the
bard is to pay the penalty condign, Phoebus and the Muses make this request‚
that if Arthur is not to you what of old he was, you, Tilen, may condescend
to be to him what you have been. ·

10. IONSTONUS.

Da veniam vati, meritas mox improba poenas
Charta dabit, magnis obstrepere ausa Deis.
In cinerem vertent, quibus insultaverat, ignes,
Et cinis ultrices experietur aquas.
Aut si, quam meruit, vati quoque poena luenda est, 5
Unum hoc te Phoebus Pieridesque rogant :
Ut, tibi si non est Arcturus, quod fuit olim,
Illi tu, quod eras, esse, Tilene, velis.

ΙΙ. TILEN.

Arthur had said [cf. No. 1 above] that no disaster from Vesta nor any
from Doris was to be dreaded by this hearth and home. Ere long the bard
under another spell [cf. palinodia, No. 2] changed his tune and uttered fore—
bodings dire. Even those who are in youth’s green innocence can know that
a poet’s words, so little consistent with himself, deserve no credence. Apollo
redeems him now from some Circe's spell‚ and teaches him to utter truth.
Since you, Arthur, have recovered your old fmme, deem that my old affection

for you has returned.
