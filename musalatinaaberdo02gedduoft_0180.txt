CX. ON ELIZABETH TURNBULL.

Trumbullia of the Latin is fiom the ‘⁶ bull '⁹ story of the origin of the name Tum-bum
The story alluded to is in Boece (p. 6, b). who renders in Latin Tauri ἀξία-εον, and the king
thus saved was said to be Robert Bruce (Jervise's Mcmorials os Augus, etc„ 11. 173 ;⁷ Dr. John
Leyden‘s Poenas, p. 318). See also XCVII. 3.

ARGUMENT.

Here thou, both Scotch and English, liest, queen among all the damo-
zelles that either England or Scotland can produce. Lustre came to thee
from the line of Turnbull—that race that saved a king when a bull assailed
him. That lustre thou givest back with increase, by c'sprit and noble
manners, dignifying thy line. So the eastern gem gleams embossed in
gold, making one to doubt whether from this or the other element the
splendour comeS.

1 Turnebus (but in Beza Turnebus), the famous scholar (in Freneh‚ Tourneboeus)‚ is said
to have had a Scotch grandfather of the name os Turnbull (Michel‚ Ecossmts, Ι. 246, 11. 141).

CX. DE ELIZABETHA TRUMBULLIA.

Hic Scot-angla iaces, inter regina puellas,
Anglia quotquot habet, Scotia quotquot habet.
Reddidit illustrem te gens Trumbullia, regi
Quae tulit, a tauro cum premeretur, opem.
Tu decus acceptum reddis maioribus, aequans
Ingenio et morum nobilitate genus.
Sic lapis e'dus radiat circumdatus auro,
Ut dubites, hinc sit maior an inde nitor.
