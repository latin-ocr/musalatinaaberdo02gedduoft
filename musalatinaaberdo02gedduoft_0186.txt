2. MORTONIUS THESAURARIUS.

Si virtus vel forma daret vel sanguis honores,
” Mortonio maior nullus in orbe foret.

Of their Pirean [PierIan] treasure‚ to give same

To painful Curius or grave Cato's name.

Had thou, brave Judge, liv'd in such golden Days,

Thy Head had long ere now been crown’d with Bays,

But Wisdom now is richly prized of none,

Nor Virtue Guasdians finds till she be gone !

Six hundred years ago, how happy I,

That Day, when thy brave Ancestor did dye

His Face 1 with Danick Blood : he did bequeath

Life to his Country at the Doors of Death ;

Yet this brave act was clos‘d with one fair Day;

But thou didst still for many Years display

The Ensigns of thy Vertue, and fierce Jars,

Intestine Broils worse than the worst of Wars,

Did quen Combustions, sase did keep from Harm

Chast Piety and raging Wrath disarm,'' etc.

A more complete version is found, with some variafions, in Maidment’s Scottish Elegiae

Verses, where it is said to be taken from a MS. of Sir Robert Sibbald, “Elogia, etc.,” in
Advocates' Library.

in the victory at Luncarty, where the Hays were said to be ennobled. See No. LVIII.
