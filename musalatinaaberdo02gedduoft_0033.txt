MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON. XXV

their native Scotch had received cultivation, 01· approved itself to the judgment
of taste as capable of literary form, and we are not to wonder that they chose
a medium which circulated at once over the wide area of Europe in preference
to a medium which might possibly have interested in a higher degree a distant
posterity, but would have certainly confined their fame in their own time to
the narrow limits of their native land.1 In this point of view Arthur Johnston
may be said to have succeeded ; ’2 for, while inferior to Buchanan in variety and
fire, he has shown sustained mastery of his favourite measure, the Elegiae, in
a form to outstrip all competitors; and the laurel consequently belongs to him
as being the greatest master of Elegiae verse, not in Scotland only, but pro—
bably in Europe, since Ovid’s dayss'*

1 In this regard it is proper to recall Waller's famous lines in distrust of the vernaeular

as a vehicle, lines written at a date much later than Johnston 2-
“ Poets that lasting marble seek
Must carve in Latin or in Greek, etc.'‘
Wm. Drummond barely survives for all his English, and as for Wm. Alexander, the Earl of
Sfirling, who likewise chose English, his poetry is as good as dead. See p. 219, Vol. Ι. The
actual result therefore justifies Johnston in choosing a vehicle current, as Robert Ayton, his
contemporary, expressed it :—
“ Non qua sceptris stat meta Britannis
Sed quacunque patent Latiae commercia linguae ⁷’ (Del.‚ 1.‚ 83).

Johnst0n‚ from various scholars.
