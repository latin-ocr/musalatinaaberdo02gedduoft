ΟΝ WILLIAM DRUMMOND. 47

LXXVI. ΟΝ WILLIAM DRUMMOND.

The friend of Ben Jonson and celebrated poet of Hawthornden, to whom John Leech
or Leochaeus also devotes his Epigram XXXIX. in his praise. Scotstarvet was no doubt
the link between Johnston and Drummond. A full account of his life-work is given in
Professor Masson’s admirable volume, William Drummond of Hawthornden. The point of
the epigram consists in a elever turn, whereby, in comparison with the great Buchanan,
Drummond is made the gainer by getting the first place in the then narrow contemporary
suffrage of his country Scotland3 while Buchanan comes out the loser by getting only
second rank in wide competition with all the Latin poets of old as well as newer time.

ARGUMENT.

By the Latin Muse Buchanan sought fame> rejecting with fastidious
ear the accents of his native speech. Drummond, though he might have
rivalled him in Latin verse, preferred as a vehicle his native tongue. Which
wins the palm ? Scotia assigns the latter the first rank, while the elder poet
stands but a doubtful second among all the Latin bards.

LXXVI. DE GULIELMO DRUMMUNDO.

Quaesivit Latio Buchananus carmine laudem,

Et patrios dura respuit aure modos.
Cum posset Latiis Buchananum vincere Musis
Drummundus, patrio maluit ore loqui.
Maior uter? Primas huic defert Scotia, vates
Vix inter Latios ille secundus erat.
