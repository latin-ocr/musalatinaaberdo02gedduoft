EPIGRAMS. 125

6. TILENUS.

Sat lituis Martique datum: cane Musa receptui;
Est lauru, est vitula dignus uterque sua.

Quin veteres deinceps Musas tibi solus habeto,
Et gerito in cerebro totum Helicona tuo.

Est mihi namque dorni nova Musa, novusque Cithaeron, 5
Non facit ad gustum rancida Musa meum.

2. Est lauru.] After Virgil’s formula for a drawn [poetic] battle: “ Et vitula tu dignus
et hic ” (Virg., Ecl., ΙΙΙ. Ιο9).

7. JoHNsTON.

Your Muse at home, whom you so admire‚ is in her cradle, and can only
cry. Ι (10 not envy you such a Muse.

7. IONSTONUS.

Quae tibi nata dorni est, et quam tu suspicis unam,
In cunis tantum flere Camena potest.
Hanc non invideo tibi, quamvis una, Tilene‚
Pars mea sit, totam nunc tibi solus habe. 10

8. TILEN.

You say my girl does nought but cry. Cry indeed she does, and the
frequent tear rolls down her cheeks. But this is more pleasing than Aonian
dew, as full of the sweet pathos of sad life. Know you not the pathetic nature
of the Elegy, with its Pentameter subjoined to the Hexameter? Know you
not what even the rough Thracians knew, folk who mourned when a child was

born? My little Muse shows precocious prevision as to the prelude of life's
tune.
