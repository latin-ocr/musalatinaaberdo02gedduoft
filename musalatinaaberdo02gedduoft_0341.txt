MISCELLANEA. 245

4.

The cold urn contains the remains—none more sacred on earth—of ·
Bishop Forbes. Yet lze survives, while his son survives‚ his image in heart
and style.

4. IN EUNDEM.

Adspicis hic gelidam Forbesi Praesulis urnam,
Qua sub sole nihil sanctius orbis habet.

Non tamen hic terris excessit sospite nato,
Pectore qui totum spirat et ore patrem.

CORSIUS hoc sacro revirescit germine Phoenix,
Et post exsequias, qui fuit ante, manet.

5. ON THE Two FORBESES [BISHoP PATRICK, AND H1s SON,
DR. JOHN FORBEs].

Here behold the two Forbeses, the peerless sire and son, each the star
of his own age. The sire gave life to the son: now by the son's help you
see the father lives in fame. 'Tis the son who deserves more praise ε the life
he got was bounded by a few short years; the life he gave doth know no end.

5.

F orbesios hic cerne duos, sine compare Patrem
Et Natum, saecli sidus utrumque sui.

Ante dedit vitam Nato Pater, omine laeto,
Nunc Patrem Nati vivere cernis ope.

Plus meruit Natus; quam cepit, clauditur aevo; 5
Quam dedit, annorum limite vita caret.

4. Nunc Patrem] Allusion is to the volume in honour of his father, “ Tumulus,’‘ etc„
or “ The Funeral of the Right Reverend Father in God, Patrick Forbes of Corse‚'⁷ which is
called a “monumentum marmore et aere perennius,” and so, immortal.
