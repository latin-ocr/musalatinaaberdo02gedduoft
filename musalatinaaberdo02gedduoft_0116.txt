LXXIV. TO JAMESONE THE PAINTER, REGARDING ANNA
CAMPBELL, THE HIGH—SPIRITED LADY.

Jamesone is mentioned by Johnston also in his “ Encomium '’ to the city of Aberdeen
in his Encomia Urbium. On George Jamesone, the ‘⁴ Scottish Vandyke,'' as Horace Walpole
styled him, much has been written. Besides Mr. Bulloch¹s excellent book, George Jamesonc,
consult Bruee’s Emincnt Men ofAbcrdcen; also Collections, Spald. Club (p. 57). “ Heroina'’ is
given to same lady in No. CXXXVII. Compare the nearly contemporary address to Vandyck‚
by Edmund Wasser, in kindred vein.

’ ARGUMENT.

Bring forth all the colours of your art to paint the Lady Campbell:
brow of ivory, breast of snow, neck like privet-bloorn, tiny lips of roses,
cheeks of marble mixed with coral or the ruddy hue of apples, auburn locks,
eyes glancing like gems or like the stars; eyebrow like Venus' bow or
Dizm’s, when ’tis lightly curved. But, palntes, suspend your hand; there
is something more subtle than any line can render, even from Apelles'
hand. Paint the eyebrow with no pride, tho eyes full of modesty, the
sprightly being without a flaw, and, to succeecl, you have only to paint her

like herself.
