276 ENCOMIA URBIUM.

17. NEW ABERDEEN.

Epigram on same by John Johnston in Dr. G. Mackenzie’s LIves, II. 427. Compare this
poem with the similar but more modest tribute to the same city in No. LIV. In poems of
this sort a certain lieence was allowed, rising into extravagance at the close.

The New Town, enriched by the mouth of the fish—abounding Dee, from
ancient cities bears away the palm. 'Tis blessed by shrines famous o’er all the
world and temples erected by no mortal hand. Beside this rises the abode of
the Latin Muses, and not far off from thence is seen Athene's seat. High in air
blaze the starry pinnacles of the Town-House Han, where extends also the
ample stretch of plainstones in the Marlzet-place. Here one discovers the
sky-compeering Palace of the Magistrates‚ with the people⁷s tutelary powers
gleaming in colours and in gold. Why mention the triple hills, the three
bulwarks of the town, like the hills of the Imperial city Rome? It has the
Woolmanhill besides for ornament, of fairer mien than these, and brightened
by Spa's chalybeate waters. From it you look down on Jameson's suburban
garden, whose flowers one takes to be painted by its master’s hand. The Dee
brings shoals of salmon, and the sea brings thy treasures, O Egypt, and the
wealth of Ind. A bridge with seven arches spans the Dee3 the mitre marks
its founder. These are things for the common people to celebrate ; 'tis the
burghers themselves Ι praise‚ as unsurpassed in merit. Brave hearts are
theirs and golden virtue, and tried and trusted honesty; hospitable they are
and kind and courteous as the angels, while the wealth that is master of others
is but a servant to them. To give virtue its due, the city should be styled
Queen, and justly bear the title of the Lady of the Land. Other towns bring

forth mere mortals ; Aberdeen is mother of heroic men.

17. ABREDONIA NOVA.

Urbs nova piscosi quam ditant ostia Devae,
Urbibus antiquis praeripit omne decus.
Hanc delubra beant totum cantata per orbem,
Templaque mortali non fabricata manu.
Haec prope, Romuleis aedes sacrata Camenis 5

Surgit, Athenaeum non procul inde vides.

3. Delubra.] The churches evidently of St. Nicholas and Greyfriars.
5. Romuleis.] Probably the Grammar and Song Schools.
ὑ. Athenaeum] Marischal College.
