Cupid's mother. To obtain a counterfeit presentment of such a prince‚ let the
pencil be held in the Mantuam or in the Maeonian hand.

CXXII. ICONES REGIAE.

1. REGIS.

Quid tibi cum Rege est, pictor vanissime? Fuco
Martia Grampigenae cur Iovis ora linis?

Pinge genas vulgi ; minium servetur Iaccho,
Aptaque cerussae mater Amoris erit.

Principis ut tanti pictura sit aemula, pingi 5
Hunc decet Andina Maeoniaque manu.

1. Vanissime.] Perhaps an allusion to Van-dyck‚ the great court painter of Charles I.

2. THE QUEEN'S (απ, Henrietta Maria).

Married to Charles I. in 1625, fied from England in 1644, and lived in her native France
to see the Restoration, and died in 1669.

In canvas glows the image of Maria blandly smiling on you. Behold
her brow, eyes, lips, bosom. The brow beams with majesty: her eyes rival

gems: her lips are like roses: her bosom is pure as snow. Juno, Venus,

Pallas are in Maria seen united, Juno the powerful, Pallas the chaste, Venus
the charming. The better to represent Maria, here royal Juno lays aside her
frowns, Pallas her Gorgon, Venus her love-spells. Yet the image thou dost
gaze upon equals not the original, and the goddess of the picture falls short
in lustre. Either pigments are too dark, or, O Painter, the goddess's eyes
have dimmed and dazzled yours.
