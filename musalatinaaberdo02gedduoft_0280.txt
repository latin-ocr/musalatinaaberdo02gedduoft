CXXXVI. ON THE THREE GORDON SISTERS.

Spald. Trubles, I. pp. 30, 1763 II. 528—9. See the three previous poems. Beauty in a
triad of daughters has distinguished at different epochs the House of Gordon. The well-known
ballad of the Duke of Gordon's daughter makes mention of three a century earlier, about 1530.

Child's Ballads, IV. p. 102.
ARGUMENT.

Adore the three Gordon dames, and, if you list, gaze on them; but if you
fear flames, mets, darts, fiee their face. There is Anne with her torches, Hen-
rietta with her toils‚ Jane with her arrows : by them the God of Love consumeS‚
ensnares‚ transfixes hearts. As for the Fates‚ complain of them no more,
launch no more accusations against them: the Gordon dames show eruelty
more fell. One Fate holds the distaff‚ another the spindle, the third alone
cuts the thread3 but in yon trio each dame alike doth slay.

CXXXVI. DE TRIBUS GORDONIIS SORORIBUS.

Tres cole Gordonas‚ et si lubet adspice, visas
Sed fuge, si flammas, retia, tela, times.

Anna faces, Henriea plagas, fert Iana sagittas,
His cremat, illaqueat, pectora figit Amor.

De Parcis iam parce queri, nec crimina Divis
Obiice, Gordonae plus feritatis habent.

Una colum, fusum tenet altera, tertia filum
Parca secat, pariter sed necat illa trias.
