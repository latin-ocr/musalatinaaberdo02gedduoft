MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON. XiX

11th June, 1610.l How he succeeded in winning this distinction, when his
studies up to this time were ostensibly Logic and Metaphysics, we are
unable to explain; but that he crossed the Alps for the purpose there is no
reason to doubt. He tells us himself (No. XXIX„ l. 83) he crossed the Alps
twice, and we may well believe that Padua was one of his destinations.
The most interesting collateral evidence of his connection with Padua2 is
his felicitous poern in honour of the great anatomist Cassierius, whom he
describes as then living and lecturing, and who, we know, taught at that
university to 1614 and died in 1616. (See No. LXXXVI.)

The Doctorate of Medicine from Padua seems to explain, as it synchro-
nises with, his appointment to the Chair of Physic at Sedan. This promotion
is thus described by his French biographer (Abbe Boulliot): “ Tant de talens
fixerent l'attention du. conseil academique de Sedan, qui le jugea digne
d’occuper la chaire de physique‚ que la promotion de Donaldson a la princi-
paute' du College de Sedan, laissait vacante. Il y fut nomme le 15 Octobre
1610, et il parut avec avantage dans un poste, osi son compatriote avait fait
naitre le gout d'une science a peine sortie du chaos. Ayant recu la meme
annee le degre de Docteur en Medecine dans l'Universite de Padoue, il revint
ἐι Sedan pour y continuer ses exercices classiques.'⁷

In a tablet which is preserved on the walls of the consistory in connection
with the protestant church at Sedan, one finds the name of Arthur Johnston
appearing in the roll of professors. He is there styled “ Professeur de logique
et physique en 1610: regent en 1610’'. The entry‚ however, is meagre and
incomplete, and throws no new light on his history.

His further history at Sedan till 1619, when we get the next clear
glimpse of him, is only matter of conjecture. He enjoyed the society of
Andrew Melville, the Scottish refugee, who came to Sedan in May, 1611,3
= as also ofSamuel Naeranus and Daniel Tilenus, his co-professors. Johnston
had no doubt watched with keen interest the negotiations that led to the

2 It is greatly to be regretted that Padua furnishes no record by which we can trace
Johnston's progreSS. The following was the reply to a letter of inquiry on the subject, and,
although there is no kernel of informati0n‚ I give it as a specimen of nineteenth century Latin
from the other side of the Alps: “ Vir praeclare, Docti viri qui et Municipii et Univ. Bibliothe-
carum monumenta diligenter inquisiverunt, Arcturi lonstoni nomen nusquam reperire potuerunt.
. . . Fieri tamen potest ut Scotus in Doctorum Collegium cooptatus sit, sed quum huius collegii
monumenta vel ablata vel deleta sint, neque adfirmari neque negari posse videtur, eum in
Doctorum nurnero fuisse. . . . Doleo sane me voluntate tuae obsequi non potuisse, Vale.
