CXXX. TO THE READER.
Prefixed to tlte Latin Version of the Psalms (1642).

ARGUMENT.

Perhaps, candid reader, you may find here ground for astonishment, yea,
and for censure too. No one has dared to tread in the footsteps of Homer or
to treat anew Maro’s theme. Alexander had his own sculptor and painter, sole
artists privileged to depict him. Why do Ι touch again the strings of
Buchanan’s lyre? The sounding lyre of Pindar may not surpass it, nor the
Teian or Venusian muse. The fate of Arachne, of Phaethon, of Salmoneus, of
Marsyas may be mine, and madness, be it remembered, affects the whole genus
of poetS. Yet hearken to the cause, and let censure cease. Buchanan arrayed
the Son of Jesse in a robe resplendent; mine is of simpler texture, rude but true.
Buchanan adorned the king: Ι clothe the prophet: hence the simpler vesture
which I supply, like the garment of the Baptist or of Amos. My work will
be a foil to Buchanan's, which clearly shines as the moon among the lesser
stars, or violets among burs, or the rose among brambles. No disgrace to be
beaten in such an arena by one who has triumphed over Gaul, Teuton‚ and
Italian. Let my muse, in falling into the second place, console herself in
the resplendence of her country’s fame.

CXXX. AD LECTOREM.

Forte quod hic stupeas (quid enirn manifesta negemus Ρ),
Et quod reprendas, candide Lector, habes.
Iliadem magni nemo tentavit Homeri,
Nemo retractavit grande Maronis opus.
Finxit Alexandrum Lysippus, pinxit Apelles,
Artificum reliquas respuit ille manus.
Cur ego Grampigenae relego vestigia vatis?
Cur Buchananeae fila resumo lyrae?
Hanc neque quam pulsat numerosa Pindarus arte,
Teia nec superet nec Venusina chelys. 10
Hinc mihi nec laudem quaero, nec praemia capto3
Est Musae potius poena timenda meae.
Dum Iove prognatam sollers imitatur Arachne,
De trabe sublimi triste pependit onus.
Dumque puer Clymenes currus agitare paternos

Non dubitat, caeli pronus ab arce ruit.
