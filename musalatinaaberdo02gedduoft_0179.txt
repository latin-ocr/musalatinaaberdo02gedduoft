CIX. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEMISE OF JOHN URQUHART,1
OF CRAIGSTON.

Grand-uncle of the famous and eccentric Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty. Died in
November, 1631. The Castle of Craigston in King-Edward, Aberdeenshire, remains a monu-
ment of his taste and affluence. Plura in note on Spalding⁷s Trubles, I. 26 (Spalding Club
edition); Collections, etc„ 481-2, and Bulloch's Jmncsone, p. 162.

ARGUMENT.

Urquhart is gone, happiest of his time, now full of years and of those
riches which he turned into ministering servants. Ye posterity of his,
inheritors of his lands and fame, learn by his example how to live: learn
also how to die.

1 A portrait of him by Jamesone is at Craigston Cassse, and his epitaph is said to be in
Kinedart Church, adjoining Craigston. According to R. Chambers (Dom. Annals, ΙΙ. 81), the
estates were acquired “but court or sessi0n‚“ i.c.‚ without court favour or legal manipulation.
Plura as to Craigston’s descendants, R. Chambers (ibid.).

CIX. IN OBITUM IOANNIS URCHARDI CRAGSTONI.

Occidit Urchardus, quo nemo beatior, aevi
Iam satur, et famulas quas sibi fecit, opum.

Posteritas, cui liquit agros et praedia, disce
Illius exemplo vivere, disce mori.
