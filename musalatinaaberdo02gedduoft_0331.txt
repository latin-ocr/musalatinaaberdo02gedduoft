PARERGA (SUPPLEMENT). 235

CLVI. COMPLAINT OF THE RING SENT ME ON NEW
YEAR'S DAY BY GEORGE GORDON, SON OF MARQUIS
OF HUNTLY.

A playful expostulation on the part of the ring at transference from the finger os a
nobleman to that of a humble poet.

In the annals of King’s College ffasti, pp. 288-9] the poet, then rector, and Huntly (the
second marquis), as chief of a commission of visitation, had a persona] meeting. As this is a
posthumous poem, it probably belongs to that period, 1637-8, and, if so, the George Gordon,
son of Marquis of Hunssy, must be the George Gordon who afterwards fell at Alford. If
earlier than 1636, when the first marquis died, it is addressed to the George Gordon who
became second marquis, but in that case it is difficult to say how it was not embraced in

the Delitiae of 1637. The same dubiety of reference occurs in the series of poems
CXXXII„ etc.

ARGUMENT.

Alas, for my gleaming gold, my radiant sparkle, my orbed form suggestive
of the celestial sphere, my artistic design surpassing the material—the old
honour attaching to me is gone. I am the possession of a poor person now,
though formerly ofa lord. I have left a hero for a poor poet. Ill befal the
New Year's Day that consigned me to my fate. When the announcement
came, the gem changed colour and the gold turned pale like lead ; whereupon
Ι said, ‘Tis not for poets to blaze with gems : Homer sang for a copper, and
Virgil for bread. IfI was to be given away as a present, some courtly finger
of a princess should have been my fortune, to adorn her neck or to receive her
kisses. Such were my vain imaginings. But the hero who gave me meant

me as a royal gift. Let me believe him worthy of the gift who stands as
client to such a patron.
