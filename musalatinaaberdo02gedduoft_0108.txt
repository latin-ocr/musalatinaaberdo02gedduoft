ARGUMENT.

The ferryman of Hades lately got sight of Beton and, in alarm, sunk
his boat in mid stream. Shedding a tear, he eried: “My occupation's
gone, nobody will pass the Stygian Wave hereafter. Nay, I sear if by his
art folk get back their breath, Pluto’s palace will soon be empty of its
inmates now! ''

LXIX. DE BETONIO MEDICO.

Betonio nuper conspecto, portitor Orci
Substitit, et medio mersit in amne ratem.

mensque, Lucri nobis, inquit, Spes omnis adempta est,
Per Stygias posthae nemo vehetur aquas.

Quin vereor, si vita hominum revocabilis arte est,
Ne redeant, Ditis regia quotquot habet.
