xxii MEMOIR OF ARTHUR JonNsToN.

daughter of Dr. Arthur Johnston, married a George Dalgarno‚ “son of the
laird of Peithill ” (Davidson's Garimlz, p. 231). It is not known whether any
direct descendants of the poet still remain.

After his return to Britain, his interest in the Princess Palatine would
no doubt prove a passport in obtaining access to courtlycircles in London,
and there is reason to believe that the title of Medicus Regius was given
him by King James (No. XLIII. 5). This designation we find him first
using as early as 1625, in the elegy on the death of that monarch (No. IX.),
the first publication to which Johnston adhibited his name. This was
followed in 1628 by ‘⁴ Elegiae Duae‚⁷‘ Aberdoniae, 4¹⁸. (also with his name
on the title page), forming Nos. XXVII. and XXVIII. in Vol. I. of the
present series. From this time to 1632 Johnston enjoyed a period of great
poetic activity and large intercourse with the leading men of Scodand, and to
some extent of England also. Scot of Scotstarvet, with his friend William
Drummond ; 1 the theologians of Aberdeen, such as Robert Baton and the two
ForbeseS, Bishop Patrick and Bishop William ; Forbes of Craigievar, the Earl
of Errol of the time, jamesone the painter, are all stars that now swim into
our ken in the atmosphere around the Medicus Regius, and in 1632 he puts forth
two volumes of his poemS, one under the title of Parerga and the other under
that of Epigrammata. Both were from the Raban press of Aberdeen. In the
following year, 1633, he published at London his “ Paraphrase in Latin Verse
of the Song of Solomon,'' dedicated to the king, and appended thereto was
his version of the ‘⁴ Seven penitential Psalms,‘’ dedicated to Laud, and that
of the “ Seven Consolatory Psalms,'² dedicated to Leslie, Bishop of Raphoe.
In that year occurred the great event interesting to Scottish patriots, the
coronation of Charles I. at Holyrood; and there Johnston was present, and
came under the notice of William Laud, who was then Bishop of London,
and the most potential person in the royal circle at the time. Laud was
impressed with the quality of Johnston's Latin verse, and the dedication to
him of the “ Seven Penitential Psalms forms the turning point in Johnston's
after career. This group of sacred poems was followed in 1635 (London) by
a small collection of minor poems, entitled ‘⁴ Musae Aulicae‚” of which an
account is given in this volume.

Then came in 1637 the complete version of the whole Psalter in an
edition appearing both in Lond0n2 and in Aberdeen, and the inference is that
Johnston was encouraged to the task by his patron Laud, who may have

extant (Chambers' Lives under Drummond).
