XCIII. ΟΝ ΤΙ-ΙΕ SLAUGHTER OF WILLIAM GORDON OF
ROTHIEMAY AND GEORGE GORDON.

The occasion is thus described by Spalding (Trubles‚ 1. 13), the root of the seud being
a quarrel about salmon fishings: “ Upone the first osJanuar‚ 1630, the laird of Frendraucht
and his complices fell in ane trubill with Williame Gordon of Rothimay and his complices,
quhair the said Williame wes unhappilly slayne, being a gallant gentilman; and on Fren-
draucht's syde was slayne George Gordoun, brother to James Gordon of Lesmoir; and divers
utheris wes hurt on both sydis '‘'. This was the beginning of the serious feud that resulted in
the tragedy of the burning of Frendraught. Sir Robert Gordon (H. ofEans of SutherlancL
p. 419) was conversant with the events at the time, which he has fully related. He acted as
a peacernaker, and refers to a scene where “all parties having shaken hands in the orchard
os Strabogie‚ they were [thought t‘o be] hartilie reconciled ''. But the fire of Frendraught
darkened that hope. See under XLIX. and L. of Vol. Ι.

ARGUMENT.

Two Gordons fell in jarring war, old warriors both, and each a captain
of brave youths. Mars embroiled thern, and death carries them alone away3
their band, by good fortune, escaped. Learn fortune from their comrades,
but from thern learn to dash boldly on the foe—yea, ye brave youths,
unflinchingly to die.

XCIII. DE GULIELMO GORDONIO ROTHIMAEO, ET
GEORGIO GORDONIO CAESIS.

Gordonii cecidere duo discordibus armis,
Ambo senes, iuvenum ductor uterque fuit.
Miscuit hos primos Mavors, mors abstulit unos,
Evasit comitum, sorte favente, cohors.
Fortunam ex sociis, ex his audacter in hostem
Ducere, constanter disce, iuventa, mori.
