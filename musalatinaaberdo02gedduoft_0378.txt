282 ENCOMIA URBIUM,

Hic sugit, hic sequitur, victori praemia cedunt
Quae palmas superant, Elidis ora, tuas.

Hic ego sum, memini, Musarum factus alumnus,
Et tiro didici verba Latina loqui.

Carmine Maeonio veteres tollantur Athenae, 15
Urbs haec versiculis est celebranda meis.

13. Alumnus.] The poet got his grounding in Latin at School of Kintore‚ not, as we
might have expected, at the much nearer Inverurie. The town of Kintore‚ though at some
distance from Caskieben‚ was in those days more important than Inverurie, and hence it still
has the honour os giving the Fz'rst title to the Keith-Falconer family, now owners of the
original Caskieben‚ while Inverurie contributes the Second or Courtesy Title to that family.
In 1606 we hear of efforts made to supply Inverurie with a Grammar School (Davidsoffs
Garioch, p. 219), but this was after Arthur Johnston had reached College.

20. INVERURIE.

My beloved town, Ury laves thee with gentle waves and hence thy
ancient name. Don, too, washes thee with crystal stream, to be swelled by
Ury and her tribute of Garioch waterS. Why rise no proud edifices with rich
columns, no Pyramid radiant with thy titles to renown ? Why rises the rowan
tree‚ where should be by rights the laurel Ρ ‘Twas near to thee that Bruce,
who had till then been beaten, first pounded to the dust his foe, and was victor
everywhere thereafter. Not far from hence, too, Stewart's strong right arm
broke the rebel clans, and steeped in blood the clay of Harlaw. I may feel
pride in thee; the land that blesses thee with rich abundance adjoins my

natal spot. Beside thee I drew as a boy the first breath of heaven's vital air:
beside my cradle I wish to close my eyes and die.
