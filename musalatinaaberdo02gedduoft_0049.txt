24mo.¹ Title and 13 pages, numbered (3) to (15). On the last page is Johnston⁷s anagram,
erus Nos ORNAT. The only copy, I know of, is in the Advocates' Library, Edin-
burgh. See Nos. 2, 17, 21, 22, and 24.

2. Another edition, published “Parisiis. Anno. 1619²’. With no pub-
lisher's name.

24mo. Title and 13 pages, which in this edition are numbered from 2 to 13. Regarding the
subject of this satire and of No. 3, see Irving’s Lives of Scotish PVriters, 1839, Vol. 11.‚
pp. 28-29. The Consilium was republished in Octupla (No. 17), and also in three of
the editions of the Musoe Sacrae (Nos. 21, 22, and 24). When Johnston inserted it in
his Parerga (No. 8) and in the Dclc'tiae Poct. Scot. (No. 14), he substituted the name
“ Hypermorus Medicaster ’' for Eglisham, and in the Musce Sacrae the satire is entitled
Hypermorus Medicaster, sive Consilium Collegic', etc. There is a copy in the Brit.
Museum Library and in Aberdeen Univ. Library [o. 12. 58]. The copy in the latter is
bound with W. Barclay’s work on the same subject, Judicium de Certamine G. Egliscmii
cum G. Buclzanano, etc„ London, 1620, and Nos. 3, 4, and 5 are inserted in the same
volume. Barclay’s Judt'cz'um was also reprinted in Nos. 17, 21, 22, and 24.
