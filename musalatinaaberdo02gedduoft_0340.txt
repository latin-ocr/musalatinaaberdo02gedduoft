Note Forbes's birth, life, and dying day. Of high birth, he discharged
his high fonction nobly. Fourteen olympiads he lived, for Fate dared not
close his day before the time. He died on the anniversary of Christ's death,

a soldier wishing to die with his captain.

2. IN EUNDEM.

Inspice natalem Forbesi‚ tempora vitae
Collige, supremam mente revolve diem.
Editus Augusto est ; Patriis quod gessit in oris,
PraesuL id augusti muneris omen erat.
Vixit olympiadas bis septem ε condere tantum
Ante diem Lachesis non fuit ausa iubar.
Occidit hoc ipso quo Christus tempore: miles,
Christe, tuus voluit te moriente mori. 8

ἃ
Forbes is dead, the peerless bishop of our Aberdonian clime. Former
prelates built stone bridges to cross streams: he made for his people an easy
pathway to the stass. The structures they reared to God, to the Muses and
to the poor, his hands upheld. As was the brightness of his light, so was
felt the darkness following his extinguished ray.

3. ΙΝ EUNDEM.

Occidit Abrcdonae praesul Forbesius orae,
Par cui Pontificum de grege nemo fuit.
Marmoreis illi straverunt pontibus undas,
Hic populo facilem fecit ad astra viam.
Quas illi Superis, Musis, et egentibus, aedes
Struxerunt, huius sustinuere manus.
Quam formosa fuit tanti lux sideris auctor,
Quae iubar hoc mersit, tam fuit atra dies. 8

5. Aedes] Such as the King’s College Chapel‚ the College ssuildings, and Bishop
Dunbar’s Hospital.
