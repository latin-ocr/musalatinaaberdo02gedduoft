CLXIII. ON GEORGE HAY.

This poem appears as preface to the Elegy on King James Ι. which appeared in London

“ Impensis Nath. Butter, 1625,’' being the first production to which Johnston's name was
attached. On George Hay see No. XII. of Vol. Ι.

ARGUMENT.

Hay, presiding over Scottish law and equity, accept this elegy, composed
as tribute to the King. The debt is due to my Liegelord and the Father of my
country; that same debt Ι owe by sacred right to you. The same reverence

that you cherished towards him, my Muse bestows on you, great Judge‚ and
on you alone.

CLXIII. AD NOBILISSIMUM ET CLARISSIMUM VIRUM
DOMINUM GEORGIUM HAY, SCOTIAE CANCELLA-
RIUM, EPIGRAMMA.

Haye, Caledonii moderator iuris et aequi,
Quod damus hic regi, flebile carmen habe.
Haec Domino et Patriae debebam iusta Parenti3
Haec eadem duplici nunc tibi iure sacro.
Hunc tu supra omnes coluisti, maxime Praetor:
Te quoque supra omnes nostra Camena colit.
