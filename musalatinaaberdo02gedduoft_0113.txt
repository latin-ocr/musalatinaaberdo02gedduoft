ΟΝ HIS OWN GARDEN. 41

LXXII. ΟΝ HIS OWN GARDEN.

Probably allegorical‚ regarding his own library and literary avocations.

ARGUMENT.

Rivalling the gardens of Alcinous, my orchards rise stately in the public
view. Even in gloomy winter's tage, I cull the fruits of Punic land and
citrons of the Medes. without the need of rakes and hoes, this garden
grows apples for its owner with no toil. ’Tis a golden gamen, product
of the golden age when things spontaneous came. This which you till
with iron and with dung is the product of the age of dung and iron.

LXXII. DE HORTO SUO.

Aemula Phaeacum silvis, pomaria nobis
In medio surgunt ambitiosa foro.
Hic tristis dum saevit hiems, quae Punica tellus,
Quaeque ferax mittit Media, poma lego.
Nil opus hie rastris durisve ligonibus, hortus
Hie domino nullo poma labore parit.
Aureus est hortus nobis, hunc protulit aetas
Aurea, qua fructus sponte ferebat humus.
Hunc tibi vel ferro vel stercore nata dederunt
Saecula, quem ferro stercoribusque colis. 10

7. Hunc.] The editions by some error give hanc, which we venture to correct.
