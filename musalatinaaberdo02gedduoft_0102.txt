30 EPIGRAMMATA.

LXIII. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ BUDAEUS OF TOUSSAINT BERCHET.

Berchet was a French Protestant controversialist‚ a friend of Naeranus (see under No.
LXII.). He died at Sedan, 1605. Budaeus, who died at Paris, 1540, is here complimented
as the restorer of Greek literature, and Ber-chet as the interpreter, diffusing the influenee of
Budaeus. Compare the earlier tributes of Buchanan to Budaeus, Epigram. (Lib. ΙΙ. 7 and 8),

and of Beza, Poemata (p. 93).

’ ARGUMENT.

Budaeus gave light to the Muses; you, Berchet, gave light to Budaeus:
star receiving light from star. Because of lzz‘m [Budaeus] Greece is no longer
under a barbarian cloud3 because of you [Berchet] her champion [Budaeus]
is not now amid barbarian foes.

LXIII. DE BUDAEO TUSSANI BERCHETI.

Budaeus Musis, lucem, Berchete, dedisti
Budaeo, lucem a sidere sidus habet.

Barbara quod non est, hoc illi Graecia debet,
Debet, quod non est barbarus, ille tibi.
