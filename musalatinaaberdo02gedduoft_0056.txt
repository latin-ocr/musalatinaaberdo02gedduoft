xlviii APPENDIX.

Svo, pp. xvi. 4· 336, followed by I ndex Vocabulorum (pages unnumbered) A —- L in sours. The
contents os this edition are the same as No. 26. The frontispiece and the portrait of
Johnston in this edition bear to have been engraved by G. VanderGucht, instead of by
Scotin and Vertue respecfively, while the plan of Jerusalem is the same in both editions.
Granger says the head of Johnstom taken from the same bust‚ is better executed than
the engraving in No. 26. Copy in the British Museum Library, and five copies in
Aberdeen University Library‚ three of which only are complete with engravings.

16mo, pp. 157. Of this edition, which is without notes, there were two issues in 1741. They
differ from one another in the following particulars: (Ι) The printing, page for page,
does not exactly correspond, although in both, FINIS is on page 157. (2) The head-
pieces at the beginning ofthe text, and at the beginning of the Cantica Evangelha, etc„
which follow the Psalms, are different in the two issues· (3) In the first issue Corri-
genda are printed at the end of the book, but are omitted in the second, the corrections
having been made in the text.

There is a copy of the first issue in Aberdeen University Library [ΜΝ. 11. 261} In the British
Museum Library there is a copy of the second issue [3090. aa] with an incorrect title,
which describes it as *⁴ cum argumentis et notis, . . . editio altera ⁷². This mistake
is not exceptional‚ as the copy of the second issue in the Aberdeen University Library

[MN. 11. 262] has a similar title.

are printed at page 298 of No. 28, are omitted, the corrections having been made in the
text. Copy in Aberdeen University Library [MN. 7. 281].
