CVII. ΟΝ ΤΙ-ΙΕ PORCH OF DESKFORD.

Deskford, near Cullen in Banffshioe, gave title to a braneh of the Ogilvy family, which
entered the peerage under the style of Lord Ogilvy of Deskford (4th October, 1616) ; thereafter‚
appeared with still higher title (now dormant) of Earl of Findlater. On the now vanished old
“ tower '' of Deskford mansion house, see Antiqs. (Spald. Club)‚ II. 104.

ARGUMENT.

Here is beheld a porch, the glory of the north—rival of old Rome. In
sunlight it is one brilliant scene, and, but for its nearness to Bootes, Ι should
take it for Phoebus' own abode. The roos emblazoned shows the stories of
the antique world. The modern age, our heroes and our heroines, shine
forth on either wall. Great as are these maroels, they are not So grand as
those in the mind of their possessor.

CVII. IN PORTICUM DESFORTIANAM.

Hic decus Arctoae spectatur porticus orae,
Aemula porticibus, Roma vetusta, tuis.
Tota nitet Phoebo, nimis et vicina Bootae
Ni foret, hane Phoebi suspicer esse domum.
Arte laboratum summis laquearibus aurum
Exhibet historias quot vetus orbis habet.
Quas heminas, hoe in quo degimus aevum,
Quos tulit heroas, monstrat utrumque latus.
Ista lieet merito possint molimina dici
Maxima, sunt domini mente minora sui. 10
