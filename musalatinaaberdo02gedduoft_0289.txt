CXXXIX. ON ELIZABETH GORDON, LADY OF WARDES.

The history of this lady, who had a dubious reputation, is found in Davidson's Gmdoch,
pp. 220-1. She was a daughter of John Gordon of Newton, and was wife of Sir John Leslie,
the first baronet, of VVardes, now spelt Wardhouse. After a chequered career she died of
cancer at Durham in 1642. See Spalding Trubles, 11. 217. ; Gordon's Scots Affairs, ΙΙ. 134.

ARGUMENT.

The Shepherd of Ida stood surveying Lady Gordon's bower, and there too
were the three Goddesses‚ whom love for the apple did consume too fiercely.
The shepherd was distinguished by his crook‚ Jove's sponse by her gorgeous
bird, Pallas by her shield, Venus by her flame. In the midst stood Lady
Gordon, fairest creature in the world, and the fine linen garment clothing her
was as white as snow. Glancing at her, Paris, as if moonstruck, grew dumb
in amaze3 soon recovering himself he let fall these words: “When Ι took
Juno as stately, Minerva as sagaeious, Venus as beautiful, Ι was, in my
vision, blind ''.

CXXXIX. DE ELIZABETHA GORDONIA WARDESIAE
DOMINA.

Gordonae thalamum pastor circumstetit Idae,
Tresque Deae, pomi quas nimis ussit amor.
Pastor erat baculo, coniunx Iovis alite picto
Insignis, clipeo Pallas et igne Venus.
In medio Gordona fuit pulcherrima rerum,
Quaque tegebatur sindonis aequa nivi.
Hanc Paris adspectans stupuit ceu sidere tactus ;
Mox ad se rediens talia dicta dedit :
“ Cum mihi Iuno gravis, prudens Tritonia visa est,
Et formosa Venus, lumine caecus eram ’'. 10

1. Circumstetit.] Probably in some piece of tapestry.
6. Sindonis.] As a nominative, seems a coinage of Johnston's.
