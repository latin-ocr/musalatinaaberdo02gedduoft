3. TILEN’S CASTIGATION OF JOHNSTON.

Whence this headlong plunge, Johnston ? Thy mind till now maintained
an even pulse. Both stones and bricks have been provided by fate for my
dwelling in firm fellowship. The god Vulcan protects the bricks, Doris in
rivalry the stones. Neither Power will harm a product of its own.

3. CASTIGATIO TILENIANA.

Quo se praecipiti inflexit, Ionstone, ruina,
Ante hac visa suo mens sibi stare gradu?

Et lapidum et laterum fidis compagibus, aedes
Provida firmarunt undique fata meas.

Vulcanus lateres, lapides fovet aemula Doris, 5
Non nocet haec soboli, non nocet ille suae.

5. Doris.] Doris is here the antithesis to Vulcan, as representing the element of
Fire, and is equivalent to the element of Water‚ as in Virg., Ecl.‚ X. 5. Geologically it is
not so clear wherefore stones should be here classed as products of the sea.

4. JOHNSTON.

No help for thee in Vulcan, although Juno’s offspring, nor in the goddess
daughter of Oceanus. Vulcan himself got tumbled headlong from the zenith
by his sire’s hand and that of the celestials. Nor when she saw the Nep-
tunian walls sinking in flames, did the blue Nymph give aid. My fortunes I
cannot trust to those who failed to rescue their own or shield themselves.

4. IONSTONUS.

Nec tibi Vulcanus, quamvis Iunonia proles,
Nec Dea ferre potest Oceanitis opem.
Mulciber ipse ruit praecepS, de culmine caeli
Deiectus patria caelituumque manu. 10
Nec cum dissolvi Neptunia moenia flammis
Cerneret, auxilium caerula Nympha tulit.
Qui sua, qui sese non subduxere periclis,
His ego fortunas credere nolo meas.

9. Mulciber ipse ruit.] The fall of Vulcan first mentioned in Iliad, 1. 590.
11. Neptunia] The walls of Troy.
