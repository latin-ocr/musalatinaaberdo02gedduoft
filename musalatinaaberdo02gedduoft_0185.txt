CXIV. THE SCOTTISH NOBLES.

[The internal evidence regarding this series points to the period of composition as be-
tween 1631 and 1633, when Angus is still not Marquis of Douglas‚ when the Errol of the time
has a Douglas for his mother, and before the title of Lord Carnegie was absorbed in Earldom

of Southesk, dating from 1633.-—The series does not represent the complete roll of the Peerage
of that day; Sutherland and Buchan, c.g.‚ are not included]

Ι . THE CHANCELLOR.

From 1604 to 1622 the chancellor had been Alexander Seton, Lord Dunfermline, one of
the most famous Scotsmen ot his time, to whom was dedicated the first collected edition of
Buchanan's poems in 1615, and Napier's arithmetical discoveries were first communicated.
Resides a life by Geo. Seton (ed. 1882), notices of him will be found in Al. Gardyne's ScottIsh
Worthies (p. 149, Hunterian Society reprint); Lettcrs in reign of James VI. (Abb. Cl.); Misc.
sp. CL, IL, LVII.‚ 152, 396; also Corresp. of Earls os Ancram, Ι. 22; Fraser's Menteitlz, ΙΙ.
73; Fasti Aberd„ p. 273. See above LIII.A.-—Aster 1622 George Hay was chancellor, the
same who became successively Viscount Duplin in 1627 and Earl os Kinnoul in 1633. He

died in London on 16th December, 1634, and was buried at Kinnoul, near Perth (R. Chambers,
D. A„ ΙΙ. 88). Sir Robert Douglas (ΙΙ. p. 481) quotes Johnston’s distich as applying to
the Chancellor Seton ; internal evidence points rather to Chancellor George Hay‚¹ as to whom
see under No. XII. of Vol. I. Picturesque sketch of this last in Sir J. Balfour's Μενηονὶιιῖς, ΙΙ.

pp. 141-2; and in Scotstarvet's “Staggering State,'⁷ Misc. spottisw. Cl.‚ Ι. 139. Letter of
George Hay to King Charles in 1632; Fraser's Menteitlz, 11. p. 149.

ARGUMENT.

Beneath Jove’s reign [i.e., in the Iron age]‚ Golden Themis forsook the

earth; now, she holds court with thee, O Hay, below, and thinks light of
her heavenly home.

1. CANCELLARIUS.

Sub Iove liquit humum, spreto Themis aurea caelo,
Nunc tecum in terris, Haye, tribunal habet.

1 In George Crawfurd's Chancellors os Scotland (Ι. p. 160) mention is made of an Eng-
lish (J) poem, in honour of Hay, attributed to Johnston‚ as follows 2-—

“The learned Dr. Johnston composed an epitaph for the Earl of Kinnoul, the Lord
Chaneellor, part os which here follows :—

“ Gone is the wise Lycurgus of our Time,
The great and grave Dictator of our Clime‚
To whose Desert the sacred Sisters ow
As much, as e'er of old they did bestow
