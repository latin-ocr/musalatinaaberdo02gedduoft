shuns the dances, she who presides over them, a Goddess than whom none is
more airy or more nimble? Why does she, a star-excelling Goddess, fear a
Goddess' looks, and gleam with the proud light of her golden-haired brother?
Is it before this Princess that the Goddess fears to show fictitious curls or
painted cheeks? No cause for sear lest she should be thought less than fair:
the Moon may, in a mask, lead on the danceS.1

2. DE REGINAE CHOREIS.

Dum celebrat Regina choros, se Cynthia terris
Subtrahit et fratris lumine mersa later.
Dic, choreas cur Diva fugit, quae praesidet illis,
Et qua nec levior mobiliorve Dea est?
Ora Deae cur Diva timet, quae sidera vincit,
Fratris et auricomi luce superba nitet ?
An mendicatos hac coram Principe cirros,
An metuit pictas prodere Diva genas?
Nulla metus causa est, ne non formosa putetur,
Personata potest ducere Luna choros. 10

3. ΟΝ THE SAME.

See No. CXXI. 10.

The sky was lately tight-bound with Boreal frost, the streams chained up
with ice, the fields buried in snow. Now the air is fanned by zephyrs, the
wave is smooth for the ship's keel; the ground with rich grass laughs and
smiles. ’Tis the stars, O Princess‚ that applaud your dances, and the rest of
the world keeps holiday in unison with you.

¹ Compare, in the same vein, Sir John Davies on the ‘⁶ Dances of the Moon '' :—
“ Who doth not see the measures of the Moone,
Which thirteene times she dauneeth every yeare ?
And ends her pavine thirteen times as soone
As doth her brother, of whose golden haire
She borroweth part, and proudly doth it weare;
Then doth she coyly turn her face aside‚
Then halfe her cheek is scarse sometimes descried.''
Davies' Orchestra, st. 41.
