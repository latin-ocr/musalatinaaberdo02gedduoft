CLI. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ DEATH OF MR. WILLIAM ANDERSON,
ADVOCATE IN ABERDEEN.

ARGUMENT.

First‚ of one eye’s light berest, Anderson ere long was deprived of the
use of both his feet. No lingering then ; having got now two calls from the
celestial judgment-seat, he bowed submissive, and with free-will bade sad earth
farewell. Behold herein the conduct of an equitable pleader and of a just
judge. In both capacities he loves right and keeps the laws of court.

CLI. IN OBITUM M. GULIELMI ANDERSONI, CAUSIDICI
ABREDONENSIS.-

Alterius primum spoliatus luminis usu,
Mox Andersonus captus utroque pede est.
Nec mora, caelesti iarn bis de sede vocatus
Paruit, et tristem sponte reliquit humum.
Adspice causidici partes et iudicis aequi :
Ius amat et leges servat uterque fori.
