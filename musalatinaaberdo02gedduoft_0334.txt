238 MISCELLANEA.

MIscELLANEous POEMS Now F1Rsr COLLECTED.

N.B.—The following group of poems, 1-8 of CLVII.‚ entitled Musae Querulae dates
from 1633, when King Charles I. visited Scotland. They were not included by Johnston
himself in the Dclitiae, nor by Spang in the Middelburg edition of his collected works; and
the only copy known to the editor, from which they have been transcribed, is found in the
Bodleian. The little volume contains F. Kinaston's contemporary translations in verse, and
these we retain with the English spelling of the time, In this instance the English version
comes first, according to the sequence hitherto followed, whereas Kinaston naturally places
Johnston's Latin first and his own translations second.

The editor is greatly indebted to Mr. James Clark, now Classical Master in Gordon’s
College‚ Aberdeen‚ for his care in transcribing this unique volume from the Bodleian during
the period of his studies at Christ Church, Oxford.

1. TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS LORD, JAMES HAY, EARLE OF CARLILE.

Thou whom high worth and vertue doth adorne,
By whom three bloody sheilds in field are borne,
Great Hay, accept with a smooth brow my short
Conceits, of your two servants the disport.

A King’s the Theme‚ with whom than you is none
More gratious, nor a man is more his owne.

Your Honours‚ while he lives, most obliged,

FRA. KINASTON.1
