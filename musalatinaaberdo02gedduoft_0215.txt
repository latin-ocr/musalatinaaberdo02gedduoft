EPIGRAMS. 127

10. TILEN.

If one who appends “five feet’' to “six'’ is reckoned lame by you, 'tis your
brain that limps, not your limb. He is all right who can walk on two: what
shall we say ofhim who has numerous feet at his command? Even barbarians
have spoken wisely. Orpheus was a Thracian, and you, Anacharsis, were a
Getan. But as the Thracian rite is thought by you barbaric, Bacchus and
Ceres invite you to their rites instead, and a ticket of visitation calls for your
presence. Save for some serious excuse, no one of the Castaliam company
must desert the diet. Is the banquet, you may ask, under Mercury's or
Apollo's patronage ? This antepast will reveal the kind of viands.

*s 10. TILENUS.
Si tibi quinque pedes sex addens claudus habetur,
Non pes, sed cerebrum claudicat, ecce, tuum.
Integer est, pedibus cui fas incedere binis;
Quis, rogo, cui Superat copia tanta pedum ?
Saepe Getae et Thraces sunt opportuna locuti :
Thrax erat ipse Orpheus, tuque, Anacharsi, Geta.
Sed quia barbariem tibi ritus olere videtur,
Thracia quam nobis relligiosa dedit3
Hac celebrata tenus Thracum sint Orgia, iam te
Ad sua sacra vocant Liber et alma Ceres. 10
Iamque valete Elegi, nugaeque valete canorae3
Hic coenandum hodie, haec tessera missa monet.
Sontica ni cui sit caussa, haec vadimonia nulli
De grege Castalio deseruisse licet.
Structa in Mercurio mensa, anne in Apolline quaeris?
Promulsis docet haec quas habitura dapes.

1 1. JOHNSTON.

Why is Apollo to-day assumed as guardian of the banquet? What
means such glee? A goddess has been born, a Pandora of all gifts: brow
from juno, eyes from Charis, lips from Venus. O the brow, the eyes, the lips,
rivalling the snow, the sky, the rose ! Tilen's gift was Mind. If you compare
the Mind with the Body, you will say the source of the latter is human, of the
former divine.
