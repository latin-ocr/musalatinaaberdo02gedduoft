PARERGA (SUPPLEMENT). 219

CLIII. TITYRUS FASTING‚ OR THE SELF-TORMENTING
CLERGYMAN.

A soliloquy by a clergyman whose income, no doubt through the political events of the
times, has fallen low, and he informs his flock complainingly of the short commosis to which
he has been reduced. It is a wonderful grouping, for an ecelesiastical purpose, into one
anthology, of the varied imagery of pastoral life and occupations.

ARGUMENT.

I have a quarrel with you, my sleek flock, and am compelled‚ though
with a sense of shame, to bring you into court. ‘It is wrong in law to
withdraw the reaper's provender, wrong to muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn. Dire poverty oppresses me, and I am the laughing-stock of my
compeers, through my privations of back and belly‚ while your wants in
both are well supplied. My ill-clad spouse and hungry children cry aloud:
“Tityrus‚ what are you about? Leave the flock and drop the shepherd's
crook. Try some other trade, that of wielding the plough or awl or scissors
or the shuttle and such like, and be master of your own fate. Be it your first
care to drive the wolf of famine from the door-,⁹⁷ Alas, for my toils: it is thc¹
duty of the fiock to support the Shepherd. How 1 have laboured to lead you
to rich pastures, to refresh you by cooling streams, to preserve you from ill
infecti0n‚ to protect you from wolves, and all this in all weather5‚ warring
with snow and showers and surly winds. The shepherd should receive a
tenth, but there hardly falls to me a hundredth part of what is due, and so
my purse is always empty. And when I ask my rights, there is raised a
bleating protest, and some with petulant horn would butt at me. Has my
flock come under some weird spell, like Circes, ehanging their nature and
degrading them? They look at me with eyes askance, and I am forced to
suffer hard things. Yet I must use no harsh words. The Lord of Shepherd
and of sheep will peradventure send in the future better times.
