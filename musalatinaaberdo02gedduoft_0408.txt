dation of the Editorial Committee, to assign the two volumes of
the OFFICERS AND GRADUATES and BOECE’S L1VEs (together 609
-ι- xxxvii. pp.) to the year 1893 ; and to regard the RECORDS OF
ABOYNE‚ of almost exactly equal bulk, as constituting the issue
for 1894. On two former occasions, in 1888 and in 1889, the
year's issue consisted of a single volume, in neither case equalling

One result of the issue in 1894 of a book assigned to 1893
has been to direct attention to a defect in one of the Rules of
the Club, whereby the Club might become liable for more copies
of one of its issues than were actually printed. In the older liter-

ship was a purely persona] matter, and its rights were held to
lapse with the death or resignation of a member. Hitherto it
has been the usage of the New Spalding Club to consider the
representatives of a member dying in any year, after having paid
his subscription, as entitled to the books assigned in advance to
that year, even though such representative should not elect to
join the Club. But, according to Rule 9, “ Every member not
in arrear with his annual subscription shall, fr'om the date of his
becoming a member, receive one copy of every volume printed
thereasler by tlze Club ''. Thus a volume, assigned to 1893 and
appearing in 1894, might be claimed at once by the representa-
