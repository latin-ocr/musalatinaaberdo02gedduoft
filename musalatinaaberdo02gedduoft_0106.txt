ARGUMENT.

Where the jealous Fate should have bestowed three long life-times,
she has snatched‚ before three lustres were reached, the maid away. ’Tis
by virtues, not years, that Lachesis computes. The fruit was premature‚

plucked ere its proper time.

LXVII. IN OBITUM IOHANNAE METELLANAE, LADER-

Fructus erat praeCOX, carptus et ante diem.
