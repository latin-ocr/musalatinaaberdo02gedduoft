EPIGRAMS. 159

3. DE IISDEM.

Nuper erat Boreae constrictum frigore caelum,

Flumina vincta gelu, rura sepulta nive.
Aethera nunc Zephyris mulcentur, puppibus unda

Sternitur, et laeto gramine vernat humus. 4
Ipsa tuis, Princeps, applaudunt astra choreis,

Et reliquus tecum gaudia mundus agit.

3. Aethera.] As Nom. Pl. and so neuter in gender, is odd; even aera, as such, is rare.

CXXV. ΟΝ Α MARINE SHOW OR PAGEANT.

ARGUMENT.

Whoever of you admires the Lucrine lake or Nero's ponds, I pray you
behold the Northern King's performance. Lo, Oceanus finds himself in the
middle of a court, Thetis is confined within the precincts of a palace. You
have the blue sea, girt with yellow sand, and rocks with mossy seaweed 'mid
the waveS. It now lies calm, anon it rises stirred by no wind, and the wave
gathers its alternate swell and fall. Again it boils in fury and threatens the
stars3 anon you would say the Stygian depths were bared in the tossing surge.
Nor is it a sea without sails and with no mariner to direct the keels‚ no twisted
conch of the sea-green God. Thetis herself is amazed at sails by no winds
‚ propelled‚ Nereus wonders at floods out of flaxen shrouds, and the ruler of the
main marvels at water which does not wet. The dominion of the sea, O King,

is all your own; beneath a roof you compress the blue expanse, and you fashion
oceans when you choose.
