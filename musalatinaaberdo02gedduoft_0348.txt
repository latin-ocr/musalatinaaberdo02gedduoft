CLXV. EXHORTATION TO THE SCOTS IN THE MATTER
OF THE RECENT COVENANT.

The poem here first included in the collected works of Arthur Johnston has had a
strange history. It is a remonstrance against his countryrnen for raising the standard os
civil war, and was sent to Holland to be included in the Middelburg edition3 but, according
to the account of Parson Gordon of Rothiemay, it was tampered with by William Spang, the
editor <as to whom see No. CXLIV.)‚ and was not then printed. It is here drawn from the
version of it appearing in the preface to Gordon’s Scots Affairs (Sp. CL), I. p. 32.

ARGUMENT.

O martial race, dearer than my life to me, why this madness of civil
broil? Let the Rhine and Elbe give witness as to its horrorS. Germany
was once a land of peace and plenty, learning a'nd the Muses. Mars has
laid it waste, and saith and piety have fied. Shun such whirlpools‚ O land of
Fergus; thou hast all the resources of a happy people, but Mars once lighting
his torch will consume thy felicities. A long period of repose has blunted thy
energies and rusted thy arms, and then, where are the sinews of war ? There
is no Pactolus running sands of gold for thee, and if we take away thy herds
and crops and the produce of thy nets, thou hast no money to pay a soldier.
Nor hast thou fortified towns or fleets and thunderbolts of cannon, and, where
a thousand are as good the one as the other, there may be a feud as to who is
to be commander. The king, who is of Scottish blood, bids thee, my Scotia,
obey. There is still room for pardon, and Charles offers such spontaneously.
So count it base to dip thy sword in the blood of brothers; turn thy arms

against some external enemy : thy present madness is because thou art with·
out a proper foe.
