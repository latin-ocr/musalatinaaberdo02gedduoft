CXLV. ΟΝ ΤΙ-ΙΕ LIKENESS OF MR. DAVID BETON‚
DOCTOR OF MEDICINE, PHYSICIAN TO THE KING.

See No. LXIX. on the Betons as physicians.

ARGUMENT.

’Tis Beton's likeness you behold; his breathing image is before you,
representing, as is meet, at once the sage of Cos and him of Pergamus. He ⁴
of Cos was physician to kings; the other to Caesar of the Capitol: this was
likewise a royal physician and imperial too. While the elever painter strives
to represent the rest, his art doth fail, and the canvas shows no trifling short-
coming. Gifted with so many languages, such faculty of brilliant speech, the
subject of his art yet seems here to laek all voice. Again the painter failed
when he varnished outwardly that breast which knows no varnish at all within.

CXLV. DE EFFIGIE D. DOCTORIS DAVIDIS BETONII,
MEDICI REGII.

Adspicis effigiem Betoni, spirat imago
Iure simul Coum Pergameumque senem.
Cous erat regum, Tarpeii Caesaris alter,
Regius hic medicus Caesareusque fuit.
Cetera dum sollers conatur reddere pictor,
Deficit ars, tabulae nec levis error inest.
Cui tot sunt linguae, dicendi tanta facultas,
Et nitor, hic omni voce carere vides.
Hic quoque deliquit pictor, cum pectora fuco
Oblevit‚ fuci quae nihil intus habent. 10
