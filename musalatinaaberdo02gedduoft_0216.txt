11. IONSTONUS.

Cur hodie nobis structa est in Apolline coena?
Quid sibi tanta volunt gaudia? Nata Dea est.
Nata Dea est, et nata Deis Pandora: dederunt
Frontem Iuno, Charis lumina, labra Venus.
Quae frons ista Deae? quae lumina? quae labra? Certat 5
Frons nivibus, caelo lumina, labra rosis.
Tilenus mentem dedit: hanc cum corpore confer,
Hoc homines dices, hanc genuisse Deos.

CXVIII. TO ANDREW MELVILLE, ΟΝ Α MELON SENT
TO TILEN.

(See Nos. LXXXIII. and LXXXV.)

The famous Andrew Melville died at Sedan in 1622, aged 77 years. No trace of his
tornb or testing-place seems to be now known at Sedan.

ARGUMENT.

A prime melon, Melville‚ Ι presented to Tilen, the prize-product of my
garden. A similar gift should have fallen to you, but these apples of honey
are not good for an old man. Cinnamon suits better an old man's stomach‚
and pepper and Falernian from an ancient cask, or grapes from the Euganean
hills, or eggs warm from their inother’s nests, hare, and partridge, and a tender
kid, or the bird that hails from Phasis. These are the gifts for you; to one
as cold as winter, melon would be as hemlock.
