PARERGA (sUPPLEMENT>. 209

PosTHUMous ADDITIONS To THE “ PARERGA ” As APPEARING IN
MIDDELBURG EDITION oF 1642.

CLII. 1. MINERVA TO VENUS.

This, with its pendant, No. 2, forms a pair of poems, in which an epistolary debate between
the two rival goddesses, presiding over wisdom and love respectively, is instituted. The whole
is a fine tesselation of gems from ancient mythology enriched with ore of more modern fancy,

and the vein recalls the kindred contest in the “ Princess'’ of Tennyson between the Lady
Blanche and Lady Psyche.

ARGUMENT-

Thus writes Pallas, and do thou, her Cyprian sister, read; likewise thy
boy should hear the indictment preferred against you both. 'Tis no old
offences, such as led to the tragedy of Troy, that Ι complain of, nor thy
favours to Mars and to Adonis: thy own husband [Vulcan] can deal with
these. What Ι complain of is violence and violated rights and torches
introduced into my fortress. The youths that I have selected for study
are assailed by the darts of Cupid, and the myrtle takes the place of the
laurel. Hence, with this tide of marriages, thou art encroaching on my
domain. Nuptials I disregard, and so do the Muses, who disown, as witness
Pyreneus, the rule of thee and thy son. True, there is some pleasure in
domestic bliss and listening to the broken lispings of some young prattler.
Yet every such sweet has its sour. The poor student among his books, when
the pinch of poverty comeS, is distracted by a wife's threats and a child’s
complainings. Yea, there may come a ri0t‚ with the starving servants
hurling missiles about his earS. What can he do but submit? The poor
· man will have to rock the cradle and turn the spit in order to keep down
din. Meantime the sponse, having got the upper hand, indulges in ease,
then in luxury3 as changeful she, as Proteus or the Moon. All the while
his purse is ebbing, and save his books he has no gear to boast of. Then
co‘mes dishealth to his aging spouse, and the doctor's fee depletes to poverty.
Alas‚ what an example was Socrates of hapless matrimonyl Even death
does not close the catalogue of its evils: witness Orpheus and his wanderings
and perils in the infernal world searching for his spouse. Ah, sister, cease
to torment my devotees. Let thy son touch my worshippers with his lenden

dart.
