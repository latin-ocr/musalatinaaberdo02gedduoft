CXII. ΟΝ THE TWO HAMILTONS, THE MARQUIS [OF
HAMILTON] AND EARL OF HADDINGTON.

On these peers, see CXIV. 3 and 5. The encomium here must be confessed to over-
shoot the mark; but, though a poet, Johnston was no prophet, and little discerned the grim
decapitation scene awaiting the former [the Marquis] after Preston, in March, 1649.

ARGUMENT.

What age can fail to mark the Hamiltons’ renown, a race that has given
two Phoenixesl to the world? One fulminates victorious in Germany: the

other directs the sceptre of justice at home. Give back, ye Muses, old
Homer: another Achilles has returned; another wise Ulysses springs anew
in Seotland.

1This encomium has been applied to Arthur Johnston himself and his brother as two
Phoenixes.

CXII. DE DUOBUS HAMILTONIIS, MARCHIONE ET
HADINTONIAE COMITE.

Gentis Hamiltoniae laudes quae nesciat aetas,
Phoenices orbi quae dedit una duos?

Hic in Teutonicis iam victor fulminat oris,
Hie patriae, magno sub Iove, iura regit.

Reddite Maeoniden Musae3 redit alter Achilles,
Dat Laertiaden Scotica terra novum.
