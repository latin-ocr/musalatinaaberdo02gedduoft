XVl MEMOIR ΟΡ ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

1490 in the case of Arthur, fifth Lord Forbes; and in the skirmishes and feuds
of the Gordons and Forbeses we hear of Arthur Forbes‚ known as Black
Arthur, a son of Lord Forbes, as slain at Tillyangus in 1571.¹ (Misc.‚
Sp. Cl., ΙΙ., p. 38, and cf. Sir R. Gordon’s Earldom of Sutherland.) Apart
altogether from the collateral affinities, the Johnston family possessed in
itself a foremost place2 among the baronage of Scossand, and there is reason
to believe that a fairly good title could have been made out under old
Scottish law, for the Earldom of Mar falling to their line. (See note
in Vol. 1.‚ p. 210.) Their seat was Caskieben, on or near the site of what is
now the modern Keithhall,3 close to Inverury; and there the poet spent his
youthful years, as he himself informs us (Vol. ΙΙ., No. LVII.), under the evening
shadow of big Benachie and near the streams of Gadie and Urie, which water
the valley of the Garioch to the north of that mountain, and unite with the Don
near Inverury. The region was one of stirring memories: the battlefield of
Inverury was close by, where Bruce won his first victory and commenced his
triumphant march to Bannockburn‚ and not far off was the field of Harlaw
(the poet's encomium on Invermy, No. 20, conjoins these two local battlefields)‚
at the last of which, in 141 1, the Celtic clans met a great defeat, preliminary το,
and premonitory of, the greater disaster of a later day at the battle of Culloden¹
Little is known of his father George, except that he was a good Protestant,
and ‘⁴ subscribed the Bande anent the religioun at Aberdeen in 1592 '' (Cal-
derw.‚ 5774). He was also on the Commission along with Earl Marischal
to seek and take the ‘⁴ three Popish Lords,'' but his death in 1593 prevented
him from taking part in the Glenlivet battle of 1594.

The school education of the young Arthur appears to have been in a
seminary at Kintore, where he tells us in his Encomia Urbium he learned his

Latin :—
“ Hic ego sum, memini, Musarum factus alumnus,

Et tiro didici verba Latina loqui ⁷’.

¹ It is supposed that the poet was named after his uncle, the Hon. Arthur Forbes of
Towie, killed at Paris, 1574 (Sir R. Gordon’s Earldom of Sutherland, p. 171), a nephew of
Black Arthur of the Tillyangus fray.

'² In the valuation of 1549 (Collections, Sp. cl„ p. 116), ⁴· the Lard ofJohnstoune '' (along
with and abreast of Drum) is among the highest, apart from peers of the realrn.

³ By 1669 Caskieben is in the hands os Keiths (Jaffray‘s Diary, p. 184), being then lost to
the Johnstons. Caskieben, that now is, is in the parish of Dyce, about eight miles from
Aberdeen. lt was originally called Newplace⁷ but the Johnstons in losing the primal
Caskieben transferred the name which still adheres. Even the second Caskieben passed into
other hands, among others, those of Alexander Henderson os Caskieben, the learned author
os the work on Ancient and Modern Wines; whence Lord Rutherford's joke as to Caskie-ben
being the Scotch translation of Horace's Interiora nota Falerni.
