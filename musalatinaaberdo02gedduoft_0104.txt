LXV. ΟΝ DR. PATRICK DUN, PHYSICIAN.

Doctor “in Physick‚'‘ fifth Principal of Marisehal College and generous endower os
the Grammar School of Aberdeen, to which, by deed of date 3rd August, 1631, he left his
estate of Ferryhill.¹ His pertrait is reproduced in the Fasti Mariscallani of New Spalding
Club, where a full account (p. 231) of his record is given by Mr. P. J. Anderson, ‘the most
careful of editors. See also Bulloch's Jamesone, p. 125. He was himself a composer in
Latin verse, and commendatory verses appear in laureation theses, printed at Basle in
1607, proceeding from ‘⁶ Patricius Dunaeus, scotus ’'. A kinsman of the same name founded
Dun's Hospital in Dublin, which has had a long and interesting history.

ARGUMENT.

Scotland brought Dun forth to light, but not right it was in her-to give
him a name dusky and dun. Matched with his pure white fame, lilies turn
pale, milk becomes dark, snow of Scythia black, and the swan grows swart.

¹ The poet's brother, Dr. William Johnston, is named as a manager under Dr. Dun's
deed of endowment‚ and there appears to have been a blood-relationship between the Duns
and Johnstons. See Memoz'r of James Young, ete.‚ p. xlii. ’ “ W. Jonstoun and Patrick
Dune'’ sign together in deed of 1626 (Fasti Marisa. of P. J. Anderson, p. 146). Plura,

LXV. DE PATRICIO DUNAEO MEDICO.

Non bene Dunaeo ductum a fuscedine nornen,
Quae tulit in lucem, Scotica terra dedit.
Candori collata viri, sunt lilia fusca,
Lac atrum, Scythiae nix nigra, furvus olor.

1. Dunaeo.] The pun seems to be on the English adjective “dun‚’' i.e.‚ dusky.
The Celtic “dhu'' (black) is more remote. The old spelling is not unfrequently Dune,
on which Dunaeus seem's to rest.
