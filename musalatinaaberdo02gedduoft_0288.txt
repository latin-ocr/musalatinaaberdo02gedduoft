2. ΟΝ THE SAME LADY.

On her embroideries see No. LIII. A.

Another Penelope lies here, another Pallas, as potent with the shuttle as
with the Babyloniam needle. We have seen wild beasts by her art embroidered
in gold, and birds on fine linen clad in varied plumage. We have seen, in
silves, fishes depicted underneath the deep, and Nymphs such as bear sway in
the glassy waves. Upon the silkworms' spoils a Goddess's cunning hand
inwove fiowers, and apples rivalling the fruit-casks of Tyre. The same deft
hand made kings and captains to step into view in tapestry hangings, and with
bold art fashioned lordly rnen as Gods. In short, whatever prophetie poets
have portrayed in song, her needle has bidden live for aye. Ye weird sistere,
who rule the spindles and life's thread, this lady surely should have been safe
from you.

2. DE EADEM.

Altera Penelope iacet hic, iacet altera Pallas,
Tam radio pollens quam Babylonis acu.
Illius arte feras intexi vidimus auro,
Et volucres bysso multicolore tegi.
Vidimus argento pictos sub gurgite pisces,
Et Nymphas vitreis quae dominantur aquis.
Bombycum spoliis Divae sollertia fiores
Texuit, et Tyriis aemula poma cadis.
Intulit aulaeis eadem regesque ducesque,
Audaci dominos finxit et arte Deos. 10
Denique fatidici quidquid cecinere Poetae,
Illius aeternum vivere iussit acus.
Quae regitis fusos et vitae fila sorores,
Haec saltem vobis non violanda fuit.
