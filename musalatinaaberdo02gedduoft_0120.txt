LXXVII. TO THE PLEADERS AT THE ΒΑΚ, NOT TO
BETRAY THE ROYAL CAUSE. ’

This poem, as appearing in the edition of 1632, is probably aimed at the English lawyers,
who were by that time busy assailing the prerogative. The Scottish embroglio with the king
up to 1637 turned on ecclesiastica rights rather than parliamentary and legal privileges.

ARGUMENT.

Frequenter of courts and Themis’ realrn, daub not the face of the king.
Hands of *thunder he can stretch afar. Cease to pluck the heard of the
sleeping lion. Claws he has, to protect that beard.

LXXVII. AD CAUSIDICOS‚ NE PRODANT CAUSAM
REGIAM.

Qui sora, qui Themidem colis, os ne subline Regi;
Fulmineas longe porrigit ille manus.

Vellere sopito barbam desiste leoni,
Hic ungues, barbam qui tueantur, habet.
